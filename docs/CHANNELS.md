# Distribution channels

This page is the coverage matrix for StorageBase Studio: every place the product can
be obtained from, which of them are live today, and which platforms they serve.
For install and operate instructions, use [DISTRIBUTION.md](DISTRIBUTION.md). The
machine-readable inventory behind this page is
[`distribution/channels.yaml`](../distribution/channels.yaml).

**Users** — find your platform in the Platform column, then follow the Guide link
for the install or deploy steps.

**Developers** — the Updates column says whether release CI publishes the channel
or a human updates it by hand, and how quickly it is expected to follow a release.
New channels are added in
[`distribution/channels.yaml`](../distribution/channels.yaml), which also drives the
product itself: the login page renders the live channels straight from that
inventory (`bun run channels:showcase`, gated in CI), so flipping a channel to
`live` publishes it in the UI with no code change.

**Buyers, investors, supporters** — the snapshot below is the coverage claim.
`pending` and `deprecated` rows are listed on purpose, not hidden.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `live` | Listed and installable (or deployable) through that channel |
| `pending` | Submission or first listing in progress |
| `deprecated` | Closed or declined — kept for honesty (for example Flathub) |

Platform counts cover live channels only, and a channel serving several
platforms is counted once for each — so they overlap, and their sum is not a
channel count.

<!-- END:CHANNEL-TABLE -->

The scorecard and table above are generated from
[`distribution/channels.yaml`](../distribution/channels.yaml). Do not edit them by
hand. To propose a new channel, add an entry with a `category` and a `platforms`
list, then run `bun run distribution:matrix`. Freshness is enforced on pull
requests with `bun run distribution:matrix --check`.

Not counted here, and why. **Alibaba Cloud** is not being pursued. **Coolify**
declined the submission: its maintainers accept service templates only from
projects above 1000 GitHub stars. **Dokku** has no application catalog to apply
to. A row appears above as soon as there is something to track — a submission,
or a descriptor in this repo that a workflow reads — and stays `pending` until
the product can be installed from that channel, when it becomes `live`.
