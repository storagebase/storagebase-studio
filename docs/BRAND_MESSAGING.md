# LibreDB Brand Messaging

The messaging architecture marketing teams work from: what LibreDB claims, who it says it to, what backs each claim, and what it will not say.

## Positioning statement

> For engineering teams whose databases live in the cloud, StorageBase Studio is the database editor that deploys next to the data instead of onto your laptop: one browser tab for PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite, libSQL, DuckDB, Couchbase, ClickHouse, Druid, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Trino and Cassandra, with SSO and audit built in, under MIT with nothing held back.

One sentence, one reference point. Everything else in this brief either supports it or is cut.

## Brand story

### The spark

You create a Postgres on Railway. It is ready in forty seconds.

Then you want to look inside it. So you open the port to the internet, or you install a desktop client and dig an SSH tunnel to reach it, or you give up and drive it from a shell. The database took forty seconds. Opening a window into it takes the rest of the afternoon.

Somewhere in that afternoon the question arrives: why doesn't the database simply come with an editor beside it?

### And it compounds

Now multiply. The team runs Postgres for the application, Mongo for documents, Redis for the cache, ClickHouse for the events. Four databases, four clients, four sets of credentials.

A new engineer joins on Monday. Before writing a line of code they spend their first days working out which data lives where, hunting connection strings across a wiki and three private messages, waiting on VPN access, and installing a different tool per engine. The forty-second problem, times four databases, times everyone on the team.

### What moved, and what stayed

Databases moved. They live in Kubernetes now, in Railway and Dokploy and a managed cloud, in a customer's VPC reached through a jump host.

The tools that read them did not move. They are still desktop applications: heavy, licensed per seat, install-first, built on the assumption of one database, one laptop, and one person who never changes machines.

### The belief

The tool goes to the data. Not the data to the tool.

### What the belief forces

Take it seriously and it stops being a preference. It becomes a specification.

If the editor lives beside the data, it has to run in a browser, because the data is not on your machine and neither are your teammates. It has to reach a phone, because the incident that needs a query does not wait for you to open a laptop. It has to deploy like infrastructure — a container, a Helm chart, an operator, a one-click template — because that is how everything else next to a database gets installed. It has to be embeddable, because the most useful place for an editor is inside the product that created the database.

And it has to be unrestricted. You cannot place a per-seat licensed, feature-gated tool into every environment you own. The moment single sign-on costs extra, the tool stops being deployable by default.

> MIT is not generosity. It is a requirement of the architecture.

### Why the paid Platform is consistent with this

StorageBase Studio is MIT because it has to go everywhere. libredb-platform is paid because it is a service rather than an environment: hosting, tenancy, billing and support for teams that would rather not run Studio themselves.

The line holds under pressure, which is the point. The editor you deploy is free and stays free; what costs money is someone else running it for you. No capability is moved across that line to create a reason to upgrade.

## Messaging house

One umbrella claim, three entry doors into it, three assurance layers underneath.

**Umbrella claim.** The tool deploys next to the data.

**The three doors** are three ways into that one claim. A campaign picks a door. It does not argue all three at once, because a piece that opens on three arguments has opened on none.

1. You created the database. The editor is already beside it.
2. One tab, sixteen databases.
3. Nothing sits behind an Enterprise wall.

**Door 3 is deliberately third, and stays third.** Leading with it would define LibreDB as another company's opponent rather than as a position of its own, and it would put our credibility at the mercy of their pricing page. Third, the same fact reads as reassurance rather than accusation.

**The three assurances are not entry points.** Nobody arrives because of a test-coverage number. People stay because of one. Assurances belong in the second half of a piece, after a door has already done its work.

## Value propositions

Each door carries five parts. A promise whose proof does not resolve to a row in the proof library is dropped, not softened.

### Door 1 — You created the database. The editor is already beside it.

- **Audience:** a developer running databases on a PaaS or on Kubernetes.
- **Pain:** the database is ready in seconds; reaching it means exposing a port, digging a tunnel, or installing a client on every machine that needs one.
- **Promise:** the editor deploys next to the data, inside the same network, with nothing opened to the outside.
- **Proof:** a one-line container run; a Helm chart and an OLM operator bundle; one-click templates on Railway, Dokploy, CapRover, DigitalOcean and Sealos; `npm i @libredb/studio` to embed it inside your own product.
- **Difference:** the only Helm chart the dbeaver organization publishes defaults to the Enterprise image, and no `cloudbeaver` npm package exists.

This is the sharpest of the three. It is the one claim no competitor can currently make.

### Door 2 — One tab, sixteen databases.

- **Audience:** teams running more than one kind of database, and the engineers who join them.
- **Pain:** four databases, four clients, four sets of credentials, and a connection-string hunt for anyone new.
- **Promise:** sixteen engines in one interface, with the same exploration everywhere, and ER diagrams, schema diff and monitoring wherever the engine has something to show. (Not "across all of them": a search cluster declares no foreign keys, so its ER diagram has no edges, and item 4 below forbids the sentence that hides that.)
- **Proof:** sixteen providers, each with its own reference document under `docs/providers/`.
- **Difference:** CloudBeaver Community bundles 18 driver modules and every one of them is SQL. MongoDB and Redis are not among them.

The claim here is the span, never the count. See the honesty limits.

### Door 3 — Nothing sits behind an Enterprise wall.

- **Audience:** developers looking for an alternative on GitHub.
- **Pain:** downloading something called open source and finding single sign-on, ER diagrams and the AI assistant behind a licence.
- **Promise:** all of it under MIT, with no capability held back.
- **Proof:** OIDC single sign-on, ER diagrams, AI-assisted SQL and the NoSQL engines all ship in the MIT build.
- **Difference:** in CloudBeaver, single sign-on is Enterprise and AWS only, ER diagrams are "Available only in PRO", the AI assistant is Enterprise, and NoSQL is absent from the Community driver set.

State the four gated capabilities as facts with their sources attached. Never as an accusation.

### Assurance 1 — Governance

For the lead deciding whether a team is allowed to use this. OIDC single sign-on against any compliant provider. Role-based access control separating admin from user. An audit trail of executed queries. Risk analysis before a destructive statement runs. Display masking for screen sharing, within the limits stated below. And deployment inside the network, so no database port has to face outward.

### Assurance 2 — Maturity

For anyone asking whether this is a weekend project. 100% line coverage enforced as a CI gate. MIT. Four releases tagged between 31 July and 3 August 2026. A Helm chart and an OpenShift operator bundle. 36 distribution channels, 30 of them live. Build provenance attestations on published artifacts.

### Assurance 3 — Founder-market fit

Three engineers built this: a data engineer, a backend architect, and a frontend and mobile engineer. Between them they had spent years installing, configuring and working around database tooling before deciding to build the one they actually wanted.

This belongs to the evidence, not the opening. A reader wants to recognise themselves first and trust the author second — put the founders in the first paragraph and the order inverts.

## Proof library

Every promise in this brief resolves to a row below. A claim with no row here does not enter the brief — it is dropped rather than softened.

Facts drift. Provider counts, channel counts and competitor editions all change, so each row carries the date it was checked. A row whose date has gone stale is unverified, not true.

### StorageBase Studio

A seventeenth, `libredb.md`, is the embedded provider and is not an external engine. The count is derived, not written: `SHIPPED` in `src/lib/db/compatibility.ts` is an exhaustive record over `DatabaseType`, so the compiler refuses a missing id — read the count from there, minus `libredb` | `docs/providers/`, `src/lib/db/compatibility.ts` | 2026-08-20 |

| Display masking is a presentation-layer feature | Masking is implemented in `src/lib/data-masking.ts` and applied by UI components only. The string `mask` does not occur anywhere under `src/app/api`, so the API returns full values to an authorized user | `src/lib/data-masking.ts`; absence verified across `src/app/api/` | 2026-08-07 |

### CloudBeaver

Comparison runs on license and feature scope only, always against a primary source. Competitor defects, performance complaints and community friction are never used.

| Claim | Evidence | Source | Verified |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Community Edition is Apache-2.0 | "It is free to use and open-source (licensed under Apache 2 license)" | `github.com/dbeaver/cloudbeaver` README | 2026-08-07 |
| Community Edition bundles 18 driver modules covering 15 distinct engines, all SQL | `clickhouse_com, databend, db2, db2-jt400, duckdb, h2, h2_v2, h2_v3, jaybird, kyuubi, libsql, mariadb, mysql, oracle, postgresql, sqlite, sqlserver, trino` | `dbeaver/cloudbeaver` `server/drivers/` | 2026-08-07 |
| No MongoDB and no Redis in the Community Edition | Neither appears in the bundled driver set above. The vendor's own editions page states Community works with SQL databases while Enterprise works with SQL, NoSQL and Cloud | `dbeaver/cloudbeaver` `server/drivers/`; dbeaver.com editions page | 2026-08-07 |
| Single sign-on is not in the Community Edition | Community supports anonymous, local and reverse-proxy authentication. SSO and OpenID Connect are listed under Enterprise and AWS editions | dbeaver.com, Authentication methods | 2026-08-07 |
| ER diagrams are not in the Community Edition | "Available only in PRO" | `dbeaver/cloudbeaver` wiki, Entity Diagrams | 2026-08-07 |
| The AI assistant is not in the Community Edition | The AI-powered assistant is listed as a CloudBeaver Enterprise capability | dbeaver.com, CloudBeaver Enterprise | 2026-08-07 |
| No npm package | `registry.npmjs.org/cloudbeaver` returns HTTP 404 | npm registry | 2026-08-07 |
| The only official Helm chart targets the Enterprise image | "# Default values for cloudbeaver-ee." and `image: dbeaver/cloudbeaver-ee` | `dbeaver/cloudbeaver-deploy` `k8s/values.yaml.example` | 2026-08-07 |
| LDAP is not listed under the Community Edition | LDAP appears only in the Enterprise Edition authentication documentation | dbeaver.com, Authentication methods | 2026-08-07 |

### Claims that were checked and dropped

Recorded so they are not reintroduced later from memory.

| Dropped claim | Why |
| :--- | :--- |
| "CloudBeaver Community has LDAP, LibreDB does not" | Current documentation lists LDAP under the Enterprise Edition only. The half about LibreDB stands and appears in the honesty limits; the half about CloudBeaver is no longer verifiable and is not used |
| "Issue #3961 proves NoSQL is unavailable in the Community Edition" | The issue is a driver-configuration question, not an availability statement. The bundled driver set is the evidence instead |

## Audience layers

Adoption of infrastructure tooling flows bottom-up. A platform lead evaluates LibreDB because an engineer already tried it, which is why the engineer is the primary audience and the lead is the second layer rather than the first.

### Layer A — the individual developer (primary)

Register: direct, willing to take a side, with proof attached to every side taken. This layer may state a position. It may not state an adjective.

Hooks: Door 1 and Door 3. Assurances stay in the second half.

Surfaces: GitHub, Hacker News, Reddit, developer newsletters, conference talks.

### Layer B — the platform and DevOps lead (secondary)

Register: calm and evidence-led, with the rhetoric removed. This reader is deciding on behalf of other people and has to be able to repeat the claim to a security reviewer without embarrassment. Anything that cannot survive that repetition does not belong in Layer B.

Hooks: Door 2, Assurance 1 and Assurance 2.

Surfaces: documentation, comparison pages, LinkedIn, Kubernetes and DevOps communities.

### Layer C — PaaS providers (dormant)

Platforms that provision databases can ship an editor beside every database they create, through the npm package rather than an iframe. This is the audience closest to the partnership and licensing goal, and the narrowest.

Documented so the message exists when it is wanted. Not part of the current campaign, and not to be activated without a decision.

## What we will not say

An agency that knows what it may not embellish is forced to fill the remaining space with real material. That is the purpose of this section.

1. **Display masking is a presentation feature, not a security control.** It was built for screen sharing, demos and screenshots. It runs in the browser, and the API returns full values to an authorized user. State this as scope, not as a shortcoming. No message may imply that display masking is data protection, access control, or compliance.
2. **Never claim leadership on the number of SQL engines.** CloudBeaver Community bundles 18 driver modules covering 15 distinct engines, against sixteen here. The claim is the span across SQL, NoSQL, analytics and search in one interface, never the count. The count moves, so read it from `SHIPPED` in `src/lib/db/compatibility.ts` (an exhaustive record over `DatabaseType`, minus the embedded `libredb`) rather than from the last campaign — but a bigger number never becomes the claim.
3. **There is no LDAP.** Single sign-on is delivered through OIDC. Teams that require LDAP are told before they install, not after.
4. **Elasticsearch and OpenSearch are a read-only query surface, not a managed one.** Both ship as of [#424](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/issues/424), so both belong in an engine list and in a polyglot story. What may not be implied is parity with PostgreSQL or MySQL. The query language is each product's own SQL endpoint — never ES|QL, which exists on one of the two and is deliberately unused, and never the native JSON DSL. Neither product's SQL grammar has `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `CREATE TABLE`, so what ships is a query editor plus an index and mapped-field browser plus cluster health and per-index document counts and store sizes. There is no EXPLAIN, no maintenance operation, no slow-query panel and no session list; an ER diagram over a search cluster draws boxes and no edges, because the engine has no foreign keys to declare; aliases and data streams are not in the tree; and on Elasticsearch there is no `OFFSET`, so results after the first page cannot be requested at all. Say "query and browse", never "manage" — and never fold these two into a sentence that says a feature works "across all engines". What the story promises, the product has to hold.
5. **Trino is a query engine, and the story must not sell it as a database.** It ships as of
   [#424](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/issues/424) Phase 2, so it belongs in an engine
   list. What may not be implied is that it manages anything. Trino stores nothing: the bytes live
   in the systems behind its connectors, so there is no database size to report and the storage
   panel names catalogs instead. It declares no primary keys, no foreign keys and no indexes
   anywhere — its `information_schema` has neither `table_constraints` nor `key_column_usage`
   (measured) — so an ER diagram over a Trino catalog draws boxes and no edges, and inline row
   editing is switched off. Whether a write works is the *connector's* answer, never the product's,
   so never promise one. What is genuinely strong is the span: one editor across every catalog a
   cluster has configured, with cross-catalog joins typed as they are. Say "query across your
   catalogs", never "manage your lakehouse".
6. **No unverifiable adjectives.** Replace each with the fact underneath it. Not "enterprise-grade" but: there is an audit trail, there is role-based access control, there is OIDC.
7. **Never use competitor defects.** No bug reports, no performance complaints, no community friction, no screenshots of someone's broken session. Comparison runs on licence and feature scope, with a primary source attached to every line.
8. **AI is not described as magic.** The assistant is schema-aware and it is useful. It is not authoritative, and verification remains the user's responsibility. Never imply a generated query is safe to run unread.

## Voice and tone

An engineer speaking to an engineer.

- Claim plus proof. Never adjective plus adjective.
- No emoji. No exclamation marks.
- Competitors are never disparaged by name. A comparison is a table with sources, and the reader draws the conclusion.
- Prefer the concrete number to the impressive word. "Sixteen engines" beats "extensive database support".
- Say the limitation out loud. Stating scope precisely is what makes the rest of the claims credible to this audience.
- Product terms stay in English in every language. StorageBase Studio, not a translated variant.

## Tagline candidates

Three options. The choice belongs to the marketing team. All three carry the umbrella claim rather than a feature, which is the only requirement.

- **Bring the editor to the data.** Shortest. States the belief directly and works as a section heading or a talk title. Weakest standing alone without context around it.
- **Your databases moved to the cloud. Your editor should too.** Carries the whole argument in two clauses and needs no setup. Longest, and the hardest to place in a narrow layout.
- **An editor beside every database.** Closest to the founding image, and the only one that also generalizes to the PaaS audience in Layer C.

Pick one and repeat it. Do not rotate between them, and do not combine two into a longer line.

## Application map

Direction, not copy. This brief contains no finished copy for any surface. It says which door each surface leads with, and why.

| Surface | Leads with | Why | Current state |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| GitHub About | Door 2, in one line | The first thing a repository visitor reads, and the only place a full sentence has to work with no layout around it | Defect: it names four engines against sixteen shipped. Fix before any campaign starts |
| README opening | Door 1, then Door 3 | Visitors arriving from search need the claim before the feature list | States a category rather than a claim. Rewrite |
| Website hero | Door 1 | The site as a whole can carry the story; the hero carries the claim and a single proof | States a category rather than a claim. Rewrite |
| Website story section | The brand story, both scenes | Nothing on the site currently says why LibreDB exists | Missing entirely. Add |
| Comparison page | Door 3, in table form | The one surface where the four gated capabilities belong in full, each with its source attached | Missing. Add, sourced from the proof library |
| Hacker News and Reddit | Door 1, Layer A register | This audience rejects positioning language and accepts a specific verifiable claim | Not yet attempted |
| LinkedIn | Door 2 with Assurance 1, Layer B register | Reaches the lead rather than the engineer | Not yet attempted |
| Conference talk or long-form article | The brand story in full | The only format long enough for the belief and its consequences | Not yet attempted |

Two rules for anyone working from this map. Every surface leads with exactly one door. And no surface promises anything the proof library does not carry.
