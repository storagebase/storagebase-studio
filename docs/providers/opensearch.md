# OpenSearch Provider

> OpenSearch support for LibreDB Studio, built on the SQL plugin that ships with the distribution
> (`POST /_plugins/_sql`, port `9200`) with **no driver dependency of any kind**: every statement is a
> JSON body and the answer comes back through the runtime's own `fetch`. This document is the single
> reference point for the `opensearch` type-id: design, architecture, usage, and tests. Its sibling
> [elasticsearch.md](./elasticsearch.md) is the prime reference for the upstream product — **one
> implementation serves both type-ids**, and the two documents deliberately disagree wherever the two
> products do.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Implemented & shipped |
| **Database type id** | `opensearch` |
| **Family** | SQL (`src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/` — shared with `elasticsearch`) |
| **Driver** | None — HTTP only (`fetch`, a runtime built-in) |
| **Query language** | `sql` (the OpenSearch SQL plugin, bundled with the distribution — no install step). **There is no ES\|QL here at all**, which is why SQL is the shared language ([§3.3](#33-sql-because-there-is-no-esql-here)) |
| **Default port** | `9200` for both schemes. A TLS deployment serves HTTPS on that **same** port ([§4.3](#43-tls)). The container fixture publishes it on **9201** to avoid colliding with the upstream service |
| **Connection pooling** | None — each statement is one stateless HTTP request |
| **Connection string** | **Not supported** — addressed by host and port like Druid, and `http(s)://` is already ClickHouse's in the shared parser ([§4.2](#42-there-is-no-connection-string-and-that-is-deliberate)) |
| **EXPLAIN** | **None.** `supportsExplain: false` and no `explainFormat`. `EXPLAIN <select>` as a *statement* is refused here; a plan exists only behind a second endpoint this seam does not carry ([§3.10](#310-no-explain-the-statement-form-is-refused)) |
| **Writes** | **None reach documents.** `DELETE` is in this grammar but **off by default**, and every other mutation is refused outright ([§5.6](#56-this-grammar-has-delete-and-it-is-off)) |
| **Transactions** | Not exposed (the engine has none) |
| **Maintenance** | None — nothing in `MaintenanceType` has a SQL-reachable analogue ([§8](#8-maintenance)) |
| **Query cancellation** | No `cancelQuery`. An abort closes **this client's** socket; the cluster keeps working ([§3.8](#38-the-deadline-is-the-clients-and-only-the-clients)) |
| **Verified against** | **OpenSearch 3.8.0**, image `opensearchproject/opensearch:3.8.0` (security disabled, stock single node — `GET /` reported distribution `opensearch`, number `3.8.0`, build_date `2026-08-01`), software licence **Apache-2.0** (the image ships the Apache License, Version 2.0 as `/usr/share/opensearch/LICENSE.txt`) with no subscription tier to confuse it with, indices `probe_orders` (1 doc) and `probe_shapes` (2 docs, an object, a `nested` and a multi-field), measured 2026-08-19. The custom-format `date` fallback was measured separately against **OpenSearch 2.7.0**, 2026-09-23 ([§5.8](#58-a-custom-format-date-field-the-legacy-engine-fallback)) |

## 1. Overview

OpenSearch is the Apache-2.0 fork of Elasticsearch 7.10. Its **SQL surface is a bundled plugin** —
`POST /_plugins/_sql`, present on a stock node with nothing to install and no tier gate — and
that endpoint is the whole query surface this provider speaks. Schema and monitoring come from the
REST APIs instead (`_cat/indices`, `<index>/_mapping`, `_cluster/health`, `_cluster/stats`), because
the mapping is the index's own declaration while a `SELECT` only ever describes a statement
([§6](#6-schema-introspection)).

The fork shares the upstream product's REST layer and has replaced its SQL engine, and **that split is
the single most important thing to know about this provider**: the same cluster speaks two error
vocabularies depending on which endpoint answered ([§3.6](#36-two-fault-vocabularies-in-one-cluster)).
Three things are OpenSearch-shaped:

1. **The success envelope is its own**, `schema` / `datarows` with `total` and `size` beside it, and
   the user's alias lives in a **separate member** from the column name — so reading `name` alone puts
   the wrong label on a column ([§3.4](#34-the-success-envelope-schemadatarows-a-separate-alias-and-a-count)).
2. **The SQL plugin names its faults with Java class names** — `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`,
   `SemanticCheckException`, `EOFParserException` — while the core REST layer keeps the upstream
   snake_case lineage ([§3.6](#36-two-fault-vocabularies-in-one-cluster)).
3. **A stock node is mostly not your data.** Measured on an empty 3.8.0 cluster, `.plugins-ml-config`
   and `top_queries-2026.08.18-74305` are already there — and the second carries **no leading dot**, so
   the dot convention alone does not catch it ([§6](#6-schema-introspection)).

### Concept mapping

| `DatabaseProvider` slot | OpenSearch realisation | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| "Table" (the relation kind) | An **index**, displayed by its bare name | `GET /_cat/indices?format=json&bytes=b` |
| "Row" | A **document** | One positional array element in `datarows` |
| Columns | The index's **mapped fields**, flattened to dotted paths, mapping types verbatim | `GET /<index>/_mapping` |
| Primary key | none — nothing a mapping declares is unique. `_id` *is* selectable here (measured, unlike upstream) but it is metadata rather than a mapped field | `isPrimary: false` on every column |
| `query(sql)` | One SQL statement, **no** parameters | `POST /_plugins/_sql` |
| Indexes | none — every mapped field is inverted-indexed with no index *object* to name | always `[]` |
| Foreign keys | none (the engine has no such constraint) | always `[]`, plus `declaresForeignKeys: false` |
| `getOverview()` / storage | Version, cluster health, index count, cluster store bytes | `/`, `_cluster/health`, `_cluster/stats`, `_cat/indices` |
| `getActiveSessions()` | nothing — a request is one HTTP request, there is no session | always `[]` |
| `getSlowQueries()` | nothing **read**, although this product really does keep top-N queries — see [§7](#7-monitoring--health) | always `[]` |
| Maintenance | nothing SQL can reach | `runMaintenance()` throws with the reason |

---

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Where it sits

One directory serves **two type-ids**. Everything the two products disagree about on the wire is a row
in the transport's dialect table
([http-transport.ts:357-409](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)) and everything
they disagree about above it is one field of `SearchProduct`
([index.ts:211](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)):

```
src/lib/db/providers/sql/
├── sql-base.ts
├── clickhouse/
├── druid/
└── search/
    ├── index.ts             # SearchProvider (abstract) + ElasticsearchProvider + OpenSearchProvider
    ├── transport.ts         # SearchTransport interface + neutral result/error types (no I/O)
    ├── http-transport.ts    # the one implementation: both SQL endpoints, both envelopes
    └── introspect.ts        # mapping-driven schema (no SQL at all)
```

They stay **two type-ids** rather than one with a runtime probe because a connection has to say which
product is listening: the SQL endpoint path is product-specific and the wrong one never reaches a SQL
engine (measured — `POST /_sql` against OpenSearch answers HTTP **405**,
`{"error":"Incorrect HTTP method for uri [/_sql?format=json] …"}`). Their grammars also genuinely
disagree — `OFFSET`, string escapes, `#`, `[…]`, backticks — which is recorded in
[`src/lib/types.ts`](../../src/lib/types.ts) where the union is declared.

### 2.2 Class hierarchy

```
DatabaseProvider (interface, types.ts)
        ^
BaseDatabaseProvider (abstract, base-provider.ts)
        ^
SQLBaseProvider (abstract, sql-base.ts)
        ^
SearchProvider (abstract, search/index.ts:367)   <- not exported
        ^
OpenSearchProvider (search/index.ts:967)         ElasticsearchProvider (search/index.ts:953)
```

`OpenSearchProvider` is thin by construction — it names its product and nothing else
([index.ts:959-971](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)) — and the one behaviour it does
**not** share with upstream is that its grammar accepts `OFFSET`, which is declared as a trait
(`acceptsOffsetClause: true`) rather than branched on
([§5.5](#55-offset-works-here-which-is-why-paging-does)).

### 2.3 What `SQLBaseProvider` gives for free

| Member | Purpose here |
|---|---|
| `buildLimitClause()` | **Both** forms are correct here: `LIMIT n` and `LIMIT n OFFSET m` (measured, HTTP 200). So the shared limiter is right unmodified and `prepareQuery()` never refuses anything on this product ([§5.5](#55-offset-works-here-which-is-why-paging-does)) |
| `prepareQuery()` (base) | The shared query limiter, used as inherited |
| `escapeIdentifier()` | Inherited and **never called** — this provider builds no SQL of its own, because the schema comes from the mapping rather than from a statement. Worth knowing that its default branch would double-quote, which is **wrong for this product** ([§5.4](#54-dialect-traps-a-user-will-hit)); the codebase's own quoter gets it right instead ([`identifier.ts:36`](../../src/lib/sql/identifier.ts)) |
| `measureExecution()` / `trackQuery()` | The measured duration is the only timing in existence — neither the body nor the headers carry one |
| `shouldEnableSSL()` | Inherited but **never called**. TLS comes from the connection's own `ssl` config only ([§4.3](#43-tls)) |

Not in the list: a placeholder helper. `SQLBaseProvider` no longer has one (#304 removed it).
Positional parameters are refused outright
([§3.11](#311-positional-parameters-are-refused-not-emulated)).

### 2.4 Registration & lifecycle

The factory wires the type-id in via a dynamic import inside `createDatabaseProvider()`
([`factory.ts`](../../src/lib/db/factory.ts)):

```ts
case "opensearch": {
  const { OpenSearchProvider } = await import("./providers/sql/search/index");
  return new OpenSearchProvider(connection, options);
}
```

`connect()` ([index.ts:536](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)) proves the cluster with
one `SELECT 1` — measured HTTP 200, one column named `1` of type `integer`. It needs no index, so it
also succeeds on a cluster holding nothing yet. It proves the **product** as well as the port: pointing
an `opensearch` connection at an upstream node fails at the connection form, because
`POST /_plugins/_sql` there is refused with
`{"error":"no handler found for uri [/_plugins/_sql] and method [POST]"}` before it reaches any SQL
engine, and the transport reports that as `unreachable` quoting the cluster's own words
([§3.7](#37-a-string-valued-error-means-the-request-never-reached-the-sql-engine)).

`disconnect()` forgets the transport and nothing else: every request is one `fetch` with no pool, no
session and no cursor behind it, which is why `SearchTransport` has no `close()` at all. API routes use
`getOrCreateProvider()`, which caches the connected provider per `connection.id` and evicts it after 30
minutes idle.

---

## 3. Design decisions

These are the non-obvious choices. Read this section before changing the provider.

### 3.1 HTTP only — no driver, and what that costs

OpenSearch ships `@opensearch-project/opensearch`, a first-class Node client. It is **not** a
dependency here: everything this provider needs is four REST paths and one SQL endpoint, so
`package.json` is untouched — no install step to fail, no native module in the Docker image or any
distribution channel, and no N-API question for the Bun runtime. Same rubric
([`docs/ADDING_A_PROVIDER.md`](../ADDING_A_PROVIDER.md)), same call Couchbase (#262), ClickHouse (#264)
and Druid (#265) made.

What it costs: no sniffing, no failover and no retry (one statement is one `fetch` to one host); the
whole body is buffered before it is parsed, so a deliberately huge result is expensive in a way a
streaming client would not be; and `ssl.caCert` / `ssl.clientCert` / `ssl.rejectUnauthorized` are not
honoured, because global `fetch` cannot carry a custom CA without an undici `Agent` and undici is not a
dependency ([§4.3](#43-tls)).

### 3.2 The transport seam: one interface, one implementation, two dialects

Provider logic never calls `fetch`. It goes through `SearchTransport`
([transport.ts:230](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/transport.ts)) — five calls, each answering
one question:

```ts
interface SearchTransport {
  readonly dialect: SearchDialectId;                                  // "elasticsearch" | "opensearch"
  query(sql: string, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<SearchQueryResult>;
  version(signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<{ version: string; product: string }>;
  indices(signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<SearchIndexInfo[]>;
  mapping(index: string, signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<SearchMappingField[]>;
  health(signal?: AbortSignal): Promise<SearchClusterHealth>;
}
```

`dialect` is the **only** product distinction that crosses it, and
[transport.ts:46-55](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/transport.ts) is explicit that it may pick a
word and never a behaviour. `http-transport.ts` holds itself to the stronger rule that no method
branches on `this.dialect` at all — it reads `this.spec`, one row of the dialect table — so the whole
product difference is data:

| dialect field | `opensearch` | `elasticsearch` |
|---|---|---|
| `sqlPath` / `sqlQuery` | `/_plugins/_sql`, **no query string** (its default `jdbc` format *is* this envelope) | `/_sql`, `format=json` (without it the answer is tabular text with no types) |
| `columnsKey` / `rowsKey` | `schema` / `datarows` | `columns` / `rows` |
| `aliasKey` | **`alias`** | `null` — the alias is folded into `name` |
| `totalKey` | **`total`** | `null` — no count is sent at all |
| `detailKey` | **`details`** — the only member with anything specific in it | `null` |
| `faults` | Java class names, plus one snake_case name from the core REST layer | snake_case exception types |
| `syntaxTypePattern` | `/ParserException$/` | `null` |

> **Seam rule.** The wire vocabulary — the two SQL endpoints, `/_cat/indices`, `/_cluster/health`,
> `/_cluster/stats`, `/_mapping`, the envelope keys (`schema`, `datarows`, `total`, `size`, `alias`,
> `columns`, `rows`, `cursor`, `properties`, `fields`, `mappings`, `docs.count`, `pri.store.size`,
> `cluster_name`, `size_in_bytes`, `details`, `root_cause`), the product fault names, the HTTP status
> numbers and `fetch` itself — must appear **only** in `http-transport.ts`.
> [`tests/unit/db/search/seam-guard.test.ts`](../../tests/unit/db/search/seam-guard.test.ts) parses
> every source in the directory with the TypeScript compiler API — not a grep — and fails the build the
> moment any of it appears elsewhere. This fork forces the guard to be narrower than Couchbase's or
> Druid's, because its envelope keys are ordinary English that the **neutral** seam legitimately uses:
> `schema` and `size` are simultaneously wire keys here and `options.schema` / `DatabaseObject.sizeBytes`
> everywhere else, so those words are matched only as exact **string literals** — the spelling envelope
> *parsing* produces — and a bare property access is left alone.

Adopting `@opensearch-project/opensearch` later is one new file implementing the same interface.

### 3.3 SQL, because there is no ES|QL here

The upstream product has ES|QL (`POST /_query`); **this one has none at all** — the path answers 405.
A surface only one of the two products has cannot be the shared query language, while the SQL endpoint
is present on both with no tier gate, so `queryLanguage` is `sql` on both type-ids. That also buys Monaco
SQL highlighting, the shared limiter, the `"sql"` tab type and saved queries with no additional code.

### 3.4 The success envelope: `schema`/`datarows`, a separate alias, and a count

Measured, `SELECT customer AS who FROM probe_orders`:

```json
{"schema":[{"name":"customer","alias":"who","type":"keyword"}],
 "datarows":[["acme"]],
 "total":1,"size":1,"status":200}
```

Four properties the code depends on:

- **The alias is a separate member.** Upstream declares `{"name":"who"}` for the same statement — the
  alias *is* the name there — so reading `name` alone would label this column `customer`, which is a
  **wrong** label rather than a missing one. `describeColumns()`
  ([http-transport.ts:509](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)) prefers the alias
  when the dialect declares an `aliasKey`, and the alias is what the user typed, so it is what the grid
  must show.
- **Rows are positional**, so each row is rebuilt against the declared column list rather than read as
  an object; the declared **order** is authoritative in a way object keys never are.
- **A duplicate output name is REFUSED, not disambiguated.** Measured, `SELECT 1 AS c, 2 AS c` answers
  HTTP 400, `IllegalArgumentException`, "Multiple entries with same key: c=2 and c=1" — where upstream
  answers 200 with two columns named `c`. So the seam's uniqueness invariant is load-bearing on exactly
  one of the two products, and `disambiguate()`
  ([http-transport.ts:489](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)) can never fire
  here. That is a fact about this engine, not dead code.
- **`total` and `size` accompany every answer**, so `SearchQueryResult.totalHits` is a real number here
  and `null` upstream. It is deliberately **not used** by the provider
  ([§5.2](#52-result-shaping)).

**`status` inside the body is ignored.** It duplicates the HTTP status, and the HTTP status is not what
classifies a failure here either ([§3.6](#36-two-fault-vocabularies-in-one-cluster)).

### 3.5 Paging: the cursor is followed, never requested

Both products spell the paging token `cursor`, and the transport follows it until the engine stops
sending one, bounded by `MAX_PAGES = 1000`
([http-transport.ts:151](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)). The measurement
that made this necessary came from upstream — an aggregation over 1500 distinct values answered 1000
rows plus a cursor with no page size ever requested, and page two carried **no column declaration** —
so the loop carries page one's declaration forward and rebuilds later pages against it
([elasticsearch.md §3.5](./elasticsearch.md#35-the-engine-pages-aggregations-by-itself)).

The code is dialect-neutral and applies here unchanged: nothing about it asks which product answered,
so a paged answer from this engine is followed the same way. No `fetch_size` is ever sent, so no
server-side page state is created on this provider's initiative; a cursor still held when the ceiling
is reached is closed on the way out before the ceiling is **reported** rather than silently accepted.

### 3.6 Two fault vocabularies in one cluster

This is the finding most likely to be mistaken for a bug in the provider. **The SQL plugin reports Java
class names while the core REST layer keeps the upstream snake_case lineage**, so which vocabulary you
see depends on which endpoint answered. Measured, one probe per row:

| request | HTTP | `error.type` | category |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SELECT * FROM nope_missing` | **404** | `IndexNotFoundException` | `unknown-object` |
| `GET /nope_missing/_mapping` | 404 | **`index_not_found_exception`** (snake_case!) | `unknown-object` |
| `SELECT nosuchfield FROM probe_orders` | 400 | `SemanticCheckException` — "can't resolve Symbol(namespace=FIELD_NAME, name=nosuchfield) in type env" | `unknown-object` |
| `SELEKT 1` / `INSERT INTO …` / `DELETE FROM probe_orders WHERE id = 99` | 400 | `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` — "Query must start with SELECT, DELETE, SHOW or DESCRIBE: …" | **`unsupported`** |
| `SELECT FROM probe_orders` | 400 | `ParserException` | `syntax` |
| `SELECT * FROM probe_orders WHERE` | 400 | `EOFParserException` — details `"EOF"` | `syntax` |
| `SELECT customer FROM probe_orders LIMIT abc` | 400 | `NumberFormatException` — "For input string: \"abc\"" | `syntax` |
| `SELECT 1 AS c, 2 AS c` | 400 | `IllegalArgumentException` | `engine` |
| `SELECT sillyfunc(1)` | 400 | `NullPointerException` (a genuine engine-side NPE inside the parser) | `engine` |

Three consequences, all deliberate:

- **A missing index is 404 here and 400 upstream** — the same typo, two statuses — while a user's own
  arithmetic answers 500 upstream. So categorisation is **body-driven** everywhere in this provider
  ([transport.ts:26-32](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/transport.ts)), the
  ClickHouse lesson from #264 arriving again.
- **A mistyped leading keyword is `unsupported` here and `syntax` upstream**, because that is what each
  engine claims about it. The asymmetry is not papered over: `unsupported` is mapped to `QueryError`
  rather than to a configuration error for exactly this reason — it describes a statement problem, not
  a deployment one ([§10](#10-error-handling)).
- **`ParserException` is matched by SHAPE**, not by name (`syntaxTypePattern: /ParserException$/`,
  [http-transport.ts:408](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)). Two members of
  that family were measured and the grammar has several, so matching the suffix means a third is
  classified correctly the first time a user hits it rather than reported as an engine fault. Anything
  the table has never seen becomes `engine` — "reached, understood, and refused" — rather than a guess.

**The useful text is in `details`, not in `reason`.** Measured, `reason` is the literal constant
`"Invalid SQL query"` for a mistyped keyword, an unknown column and an unparseable LIMIT alike, while
`details` holds the sentence that names the fault. So `faultMessage()`
([http-transport.ts:600](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)) prefers `details`
here and falls back to `reason`, and it strips one trailing sentence:

```json
{"error":{"reason":"Error occurred in OpenSearch engine: no such index [nope_missing]",
          "details":"[nope_missing] IndexNotFoundException[no such index [nope_missing]]\nFor more details, please send request for Json format to see the raw response from OpenSearch engine.",
          "type":"IndexNotFoundException"},
 "status":404}
```

That footer instructs the reader to re-send the request in another format to see the raw engine
response — advice about this product's REST API, not about the statement the user just wrote — so it is
removed ([`OPENSEARCH_DETAILS_FOOTER`, http-transport.ts:246](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)).
Everything else is carried through **verbatim**, because the engine's own wording is the only text that
tells a user which part of their statement is wrong.

### 3.7 A string-valued `error` means the request never reached the SQL engine

Measured: `POST /_sql?format=json` (the upstream path) against OpenSearch answers HTTP **405** with

```json
{"error":"Incorrect HTTP method for uri [/_sql?format=json] and method [POST], allowed: [GET]","status":405}
```

and a POST with no `content-type` answers HTTP 406. Both spell `error` as a **string** where a real
engine failure spells it as an **object**, which makes the JSON type of one field a reliable "this is
not that product / the SQL plugin is not there" discriminator. It becomes the `unreachable` category,
which the provider maps to `ConnectionError` — so a mis-picked type-id fails at the connection form
rather than later on a query.

`auth` is the one category decided on the **status** (401/403). The probe cluster runs with the
security plugin disabled and a bogus `Basic` header is *ignored* there (HTTP 200, measured), so no
401/403 body could be captured — and rather than invent one, the code uses the one signal whose
meaning HTTP itself fixes
([http-transport.ts:64-68](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)).

### 3.8 The deadline is the client's, and only the client's

`deadline()` ([index.ts:609](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)) is one
`AbortSignal.timeout(this.queryTimeout)` **per operation**, not per request — the monitoring reads
below fan out several requests for one panel, and a panel that renders half its numbers after a stall
is not a better answer than one that reports the stall.

Aborting closes this client's socket and nothing else: **no cancellation request is sent**, because the
SQL endpoint offers none for a running statement. So the cluster finishes the statement it was given,
which is what the `cancelled` message must not pretend otherwise about, and why `cancelQuery` is
deliberately not implemented.

`AbortSignal.timeout` is used rather than a plain controller because its reason is a `TimeoutError`,
which is the one signal that tells a deadline apart from a user's cancellation — measured on Node 24
and Bun, the thrown value cannot: `controller.abort(new Error("x"))` throws that Error verbatim, with
nothing abort-shaped about it. `requestFailure()`
([http-transport.ts:707](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)) therefore consults
`signal.aborted` **before** the thrown value.

### 3.9 Columns are labelled with mapping types, not SQL types

Measured: `SELECT customer, total FROM probe_orders` declares `keyword` and `double` — not `VARCHAR`
and `DOUBLE`. That is the vocabulary a user wrote in their own index mapping, and it is the **same**
vocabulary `mapping()` reports, which keeps the result grid and the schema tree speaking one language
([transport.ts:92-104](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/transport.ts)). A column whose declaration
carried no type name is **left out** of `columnTypes` rather than given a placeholder.

### 3.10 No EXPLAIN: the statement form is refused

`supportsExplain: false` and no `explainFormat` is declared, which is what hides the button and the
tab; `src/lib/explain/` is untouched.

Measured: `EXPLAIN SELECT customer FROM probe_orders` sent to the SQL endpoint is HTTP 400,
`SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`, "Query must start with SELECT, DELETE, SHOW or DESCRIBE" — the
statement form does not exist in this grammar. A plan **does** exist behind a separate endpoint,
`POST /_plugins/_sql/_explain`, which answers a tree (`ProjectOperator` over `OpenSearchIndexScan`,
measured), and upstream answers a statement-form `EXPLAIN` with plan **text** instead. Two different
shapes behind two different mechanisms, one of them not part of this seam at all, so neither type-id
declares the capability: a tab that works on one of two products behind one code path is worse than no
tab. Widening the seam by one call is the concrete follow-up
([§13](#13-known-limitations--future-work)).

### 3.11 Positional parameters are refused, not emulated

The endpoint really does bind them — measured,
`{"query":"… WHERE id = ?","parameters":[{"type":"integer","value":"1"}]}` answers HTTP 200 — but
upstream spells the same request differently (a bare `params` array), the seam carries the **statement
alone**, and inlining the values here to work around that would be building a SQL-injection site
inside a provider. `query()` therefore throws a `QueryError` when `params` is non-empty
([index.ts:625](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)), the same call
`clickhouse/index.ts` makes for the same reason (#264). `positionalPlaceholder()` in
[`src/lib/sql/values.ts`](../../src/lib/sql/values.ts) returns `null` for this dialect to match, so no
shared generator emits a `?` this provider would then decline to fill.

## 4. Connection

### 4.1 Configuration fields

The form offers exactly four fields
([`db-ui-config.ts:162`](../../src/lib/db-ui-config.ts)): `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`.

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | **Yes** | `validate()` ([index.ts:529](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)) throws `DatabaseConfigError` — "OpenSearch requires a host" |
| `port` | No | Defaults to `9200` ([index.ts:151](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)); the fork kept the upstream port. The container fixture publishes **9201** on the host, which is a collision on that machine rather than a fact about the product |
| `user` / `password` | No | Sent as HTTP Basic **only when `user` is set**, for the security plugin. Measured with the plugin disabled: a bogus `Basic` header is *ignored* (HTTP 200), so credentials are genuinely optional. Note that a **default** distribution enables the plugin, serves HTTPS with a self-signed certificate and requires an admin password — see [§4.3](#43-tls) |
| `ssl` | No | Any mode but `disable` switches the transport to `https` ([§4.3](#43-tls)) |
| `database` | — | **Not offered, and ignored if set** — see below |

**There is no `database` field, and that is not an omission.** An index has no namespace above it, and
this product's own SQL says so: `SHOW TABLES LIKE %` answers `TABLE_CAT` `docker-cluster` with
`TABLE_SCHEM` **null** (measured). So a database selector would be a control with no effect, and worse,
one implying a scoping decision the user does not have. The monitoring rows carry an **empty** schema
name for the same reason ([index.ts:167](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)), which
renders as no prefix at all — and doubles as the only value the schema filter can match, so a caller
asking for `public` gets no rows rather than every row.

```ts
const connection = {
  id: 'os-1',
  name: 'OpenSearch',
  type: 'opensearch',
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 9201,           // the fixture's host port; a real node is on 9200
  createdAt: new Date(),
};
```

### 4.2 There is no connection string, and that is deliberate

`supportsConnectionString` is `false` and `showConnectionStringToggle` is `false`, so the form has no
paste tab. Two independent reasons, the same pair Druid records: there is **no URI convention** for
this HTTP surface (the official client takes a `node` URL, which is not a credential-carrying DSN the
shared parser could round-trip), and **`http://` / `https://` are already claimed by ClickHouse** in
[`connection-string-parser.ts`](../../src/lib/connection-string-parser.ts) (#264).

`connection-string-parser.ts` is therefore **not touched** by this provider. The consequence is
recorded rather than hidden — pasting `http://localhost:9201` selects ClickHouse — and the
connection-form hook's unparseable-string message deliberately omits both search ids
([`use-connection-form.ts:376`](../../src/hooks/use-connection-form.ts)).

### 4.3 TLS

`config.ssl` with any `mode` but `disable` switches the transport from `http` to `https`
([http-transport.ts:819](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)). `ssl` is a
first-class `DatabaseConnection` field and independent of the form's `connectionFields`, so it applies
even though this form shows no TLS row of its own, and an explicit `disable` turns TLS **off** as
firmly as an explicit mode turns it on (the #264 lesson).

`verify-system` (D26) is the mode that DESCRIBES this transport: `fetch` always verifies the chain
against the platform's certificate store and cannot be told otherwise, so of the four non-`disable`
modes it is the only one whose name matches the handshake. `require` here does not mean "encrypt
without checking" the way it does on the driver-based providers — nothing in this transport can skip a
check — and `verify-ca`/`verify-full` cannot pin against a pasted CA. Nothing in the code branches on
which one is selected.

**The port is not changed by TLS**: this product serves HTTPS on the same `9200`, so there is no
second well-known number to fall back to, and inventing one would send credentials to a port nothing is
listening on.

`ssl.caCert`, `ssl.clientCert` and `ssl.rejectUnauthorized` are **not honoured** — global `fetch`
cannot carry a custom CA or relax verification without an undici `Agent` as its `dispatcher`, and
undici is not a dependency. **This bites harder here than on most providers**: a stock distribution with
the security plugin enabled serves HTTPS with a **self-signed** certificate, which fails verification.
Such a cluster needs a publicly-trusted certificate, a terminating proxy, or the plugin disabled — which
is what the container fixture does (`DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN: "true"`), and note that is the fork's own
switch, not the upstream key: the plugin is *installed* rather than a licensed feature, so it is
disabled by name.

An IPv6 literal host is bracketed before it becomes a URL authority
([http-transport.ts:431](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)).

## 5. Query interface

### 5.1 Execution

`query(sql, params?)` ([index.ts:625](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)) sends one
statement under the client deadline from [§3.8](#38-the-deadline-is-the-clients-and-only-the-clients):

```ts
await provider.query('SELECT customer, total FROM probe_orders LIMIT 50');
await provider.query('SELECT customer FROM probe_orders LIMIT 2 OFFSET 1');   // accepted here
```

A **write is not special-cased**: this grammar names everything it *would* have accepted in its own
error message, which is more useful than anything substituted here
([§5.6](#56-this-grammar-has-delete-and-it-is-off)).

### 5.2 Result shaping

`toQueryResult()` ([index.ts:275](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)):

| Source | `QueryResult` field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `datarows` | `rows` | Rebuilt from the positional arrays, keyed by the declared names |
| `schema[].alias ?? schema[].name` | `fields` | Declared order; the **alias wins** ([§3.4](#34-the-success-envelope-schemadatarows-a-separate-alias-and-a-count)) |
| — | `rowCount` | `rows.length`. There is no second number: no statement here reaches a document, so a mutation count could only ever be zero |
| the measured exchange | `executionTime` | Rounded milliseconds, **measured by this process**. Neither the body nor the headers carry any timing |
| `schema[].type` | `columnTypes` | The engine's **mapping** types; **absent** when the answer declared none ([§3.9](#39-columns-are-labelled-with-mapping-types-not-sql-types)) |
| `total` | — | **Deliberately dropped.** See below |
| — | `warnings` | Absent, except the one notice a legacy-engine answer carries ([§5.8](#58-a-custom-format-date-field-the-legacy-engine-fallback)) |

**`totalHits` is available here and is deliberately unused.** The upstream product reports no
matching-document count at all, so a "showing 50 of 4,812" notice would appear on one product and never
on the other for identical statements — and it would restate what the route's own pagination already
tells the UI (`hasMore`, `limit`, `offset`). A caveat attached to every ordinary query is the fastest
way to train a user to ignore the ones that matter, which is the argument [druid.md](./druid.md) makes
about its own warnings. The count is dropped knowingly; `docs/BACKLOG.md` is where it belongs if a
surface for it ever exists ([index.ts:260-269](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)).

### 5.3 A container field comes back as its sub-document

Measured, and a real divergence from upstream: `SELECT * FROM probe_shapes` here answers HTTP 200 with
the container fields **and their values** —

```json
{"schema":[{"name":"items","type":"nested"},{"name":"note","type":"text"},{"name":"address","type":"object"}],
 "datarows":[[[{"sku":"A1"}],"hello there",{"city":"Ankara"}]]}
```

— while the same statement upstream expands to the **leaves only**, silently dropping every container:
measured on the same mapping, Elasticsearch answers
`{"columns":[{"name":"address.city","type":"keyword"},{"name":"note","type":"text"}], …}`, and a
container named **explicitly** there is a hard `verification_exception` ("Cannot use field [address]
type [object] only its subfields"). On an index whose mapping is *only* container and unsupported types
that expansion leaves nothing at all — `{"columns":[],"rows":[[]]}`, which is one of the two reasons
the schema never comes from a statement
([introspect.ts:9-16](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/introspect.ts)).

This provider does **not** exploit the permissiveness: containers are excluded from the schema tree on
both products, because a starter query that works on one and fails on the other is worse than one that
works on both ([§6](#6-schema-introspection)). A statement the user types themselves is of course still served
exactly as this engine serves it — an object cell simply arrives as a JSON object in the grid, with the
mapping type (`object`, `nested`) as its label.

No value rewriting happens anywhere in this provider.

### 5.4 Dialect traps a user will hit

These are OpenSearch's, not the provider's. All were measured on 3.8.0, and **most of them are the
mirror image of the upstream product's** — which is exactly why the two docs are separate.

**Double quotes are a STRING LITERAL, not an identifier quote, and that is the dangerous one.**
Measured:

```
SELECT customer FROM "probe_orders"
-> 404  IndexNotFoundException  'no such index ["probe_orders"]'      (quotes and all)

SELECT "customer" FROM probe_orders
-> 200  {"schema":[{"name":"\"customer\"","type":"keyword"}],"datarows":[["customer"]]}
```

The second is worse than an error: it returns the **literal string** `customer` for every row, and a
predicate written that way (`WHERE "customer" = 'acme'`) compares two literals and answers 0 rows with
no failure at all. Backticks are the identifier form here — `` SELECT customer FROM `probe_orders` ``
is HTTP 200 — which is why `opensearch` shares MySQL's branch in
[`src/lib/sql/identifier.ts:36`](../../src/lib/sql/identifier.ts) while `elasticsearch` sits in the
double-quote default (it answers a backtick with *"backquoted identifiers not supported; please use
double quotes instead"*). The two search ids genuinely cannot share a quoting branch.

**`[…]` is also an identifier quote**, MySQL/SQL-Server style: `SELECT [customer] FROM probe_orders`
answers the field's value, while `SELECT [1, 2]` is refused with "All items between Brackets should be
identifiers, got:LITERAL_INT". So `OPENSEARCH_GRAMMAR.bracket` is `"quoted-identifier"`
([`grammar.ts:199`](../../src/lib/sql/grammar.ts)) — where `elasticsearch` leaves it at the default,
because `[` has no meaning in that grammar at all.

**`#` really is a line comment**, and this is where the fork's SQL plugin parts company with upstream.
Three probes, because "the statement still ran" is not enough to tell a comment from an ignored token:

```
SELECT 1 AS a # , 2 AS b            -> 200, ONE column: the rest was hidden
SELECT 1 AS a # hidden\n, 2 AS b    -> 200, TWO columns: the run ended at the newline
SELECT customer # FROM probe_orders -> SemanticCheckException: the FROM was hidden
```

So `hash: "comment"` here and `"code"` upstream. This matters beyond cosmetics: since #297 the
confirmation gate reads a statement's spans to decide whether a write is hiding behind a comment, and
an unreadable span is a **prompt** rather than silence.

**A trailing semicolon is accepted.** `SELECT 1;` is HTTP 200 here and a `parsing_exception` upstream —
so the generated statement (`SELECT * FROM probe_orders LIMIT 50;`) ran on this product and failed on
the other ([elasticsearch.md §5.4](./elasticsearch.md#54-dialect-traps-a-user-will-hit)). This product
nevertheless declares `statementTerminator: "none"` along with the upstream one, because the absence of
the terminator is accepted **here too** (measured) and one answer that runs on both beats a branch on
`dialect` — the same rule that keeps `getCapabilities()` a single answer for both type-ids.

**String literals accept BOTH escape forms.** Measured: `SELECT 'a''b'` → `a'b`, so doubling works;
`SELECT 'a\'b'` → `a'b` too, so a backslash escapes the quote; `SELECT 'a\\b'` → one backslash, so it
escapes itself; and `SELECT 'a\'` is a `ParserException`, because the trailing backslash escaped the
closing quote and left the literal open — which is exactly the defect #290 is about. Hence
`opensearch: "double-and-backslash"` in [`src/lib/sql/values.ts:55`](../../src/lib/sql/values.ts),
where `elasticsearch` is `"standard"` (a backslash there is data).

**`_id` is selectable here.** `SELECT _id FROM probe_orders` returns the document id; upstream answers
"Unknown column [_id]". It is still not reported as a column or as a key, because it is metadata rather
than a mapped field and because the same statement is not portable to the sibling type-id
([§6](#6-schema-introspection)).

**Multi-valued fields stay multi-valued.** Measured on 3.8.0: `SELECT tags FROM arrprobe`
returns the complete array in the result cell with an ordinary SQL request. No additional query option
is required.

**Block comments do not nest**, same as upstream: `SELECT /* a /* b */ 1 AS a` is HTTP 200, so the
first `*/` closed the run.

### 5.5 `OFFSET` works here, which is why paging does

Measured: `SELECT customer FROM probe_orders LIMIT 2 OFFSET 1` is HTTP 200 with the rows the offset
asks for. Upstream refuses it outright (`parsing_exception`, "mismatched input 'OFFSET' expecting
<EOF>"), and that single fact is **the one behavioural difference above the wire** between the two
type-ids.

It is declared as a trait, `acceptsOffsetClause: true`
([index.ts:239-243](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)), and read by `prepareQuery()`
alone ([index.ts:505](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)) — which therefore **never
refuses anything on this product** and returns exactly what the inherited limiter produced. A method
that asked `this.dialect === "opensearch"` would be the thing both the seam's rule and `CLAUDE.md`
exist to prevent; a method that reads `this.product.acceptsOffsetClause` states which capability it
depends on, and a third product declares its own answer instead of being added to a condition someone
has to find.

The practical consequence: **the editor's "load more" works on an OpenSearch connection and is refused
on an Elasticsearch one.** Same provider code, same UI, one measured grammar difference.

### 5.6 This grammar has `DELETE`, and it is off

Measured on a stock 3.8.0 node, every mutation is HTTP 400 with
`SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`, "Query must start with SELECT, DELETE, SHOW or DESCRIBE: …":

| statement | note |
|---|---|
| `INSERT INTO probe_orders …` | not in the grammar |
| `UPDATE probe_orders SET customer = 'x' WHERE id = 1` | not in the grammar |
| `CREATE TABLE t (id BIGINT)` | not in the grammar |
| `ALTER TABLE probe_orders ADD COLUMN x INT` | not in the grammar |
| `DELETE FROM probe_orders WHERE id = 99` | **is** in the grammar — the error names it — and is refused because the plugin's DELETE support is **off by default** |

The error message is the same for all five, which is worth knowing: it enumerates what the grammar
accepts, so "DELETE" appearing in a message about a refused DELETE is the plugin telling you the
statement form exists and the setting does not permit it.

Consequences elsewhere in the product:

- `supportsCreateTable: false` and `supportsInlineRowEdit: false` are facts about the grammar, not
  unimplemented features, so the EDIT toggle and the editable cell are not offered (#269).
- The schema-diff migration generator emits, in place of a column change: *"OpenSearch SQL reads only;
  change a field by reindexing into an index whose mapping declares it."*
  (the `NO_COLUMN_MODIFICATION` table in
  [`migration-generator.ts`](../../src/lib/schema-diff/migration-generator.ts)). It says *reindex*
  rather than "use the mapping API" because an existing field's type cannot be changed in place at
  all, even outside SQL.
- `schemaRefreshPattern` is `\b(DELETE)\b`
  ([index.ts:193](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)) and **this is the product it exists
  for**: a cluster that switches DELETE on really does change the per-index document counts this
  provider reports, so a statement matching it refreshes the schema. Upstream has no DELETE in its
  grammar at all, so there the pattern never fires — exactly as Druid's `INSERT|REPLACE` never fires
  against its native engine.

Documents otherwise change through the document APIs (`_doc`, `_bulk`, `_delete_by_query`), which this
seam does not expose.

### 5.7 `endOpenQueryTransaction()` is absent, and which absence it is (D75)

The optional provider surface that ends a transaction a statement left open on the session
`query()` runs on ([`types.ts`](../../src/lib/db/types.ts), implemented on `postgres`, `sqlite`,
`duckdb` and `redis`) is **not implemented here, because the engine has no transaction to leave open.**

What was read, and measured verbatim on OpenSearch 3.8.0 through this provider:

- The grammar has no transaction verb. `BEGIN`, `START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` are each
  refused with "Query must start with SELECT, DELETE, SHOW or DESCRIBE: `<verb>`"
  (`SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`, HTTP 400), and a `SELECT 1` on the same provider straight
  afterwards still answers.
- There is no session for one to live on either. The transport is one stateless
  `POST /_plugins/_sql` per statement
  ([`http-transport.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)); the only
  server-side state it ever holds is a paging cursor, which it closes on the way out.

`DELETE` being in this grammar (§5.6) does not change the answer: the fork's `DELETE` is a
`_delete_by_query` in SQL clothing, not a statement inside a transaction.

So there is nothing for the route to end, and the absence is a declared boundary rather than a
fallback: the caller shape-checks for the method and this provider does not answer it.

### 5.8 A custom-format `date` field: the legacy engine fallback

**The limitation is the SQL plugin's, not the provider's.** Measured against **OpenSearch 2.7.0** on
2026-09-23 (not the 3.8.0 probe cluster the rest of this document was measured on), over an index whose
mapping holds several `date` fields, one of them with a **custom** format — the shape a log pipeline
commonly writes:

```json
{"mappings":{"properties":{"timestamp":{"type":"date","format":"uuuu-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"}, "level":{"type":"keyword"}}}}
```

| Request | Answer |
|---|---|
| `POST /_plugins/_sql` — the new engine, the endpoint's default — `SELECT * FROM app-logs LIMIT 50` | HTTP **503**, `IllegalStateException`, "Construct ExprTimestampValue from \"2026-09-12 23:59:59.854\" failed, unsupported date format." |
| `POST /_plugins/_ppl`, `source=app-logs \| head 2` | the same 503 |
| `POST /_plugins/_sql?format=json` — routes the statement to the **legacy** engine | HTTP **200**, a raw search response (`hits.hits[]._source`) |
| the new engine, projecting only non-date columns | HTTP 200 |

So the transport asks the legacy engine **once** for that statement
([`http-transport.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts), `LegacyEngineFallback`
and `queryLegacy`), under all of these conditions and no others:

- the new engine's fault is `IllegalStateException` **and** its wording says "unsupported date format".
  The name alone is the plugin's generic "internal problem at backend", so it is never enough; the status
  is not read at all ([§3.6](#36-two-fault-vocabularies-in-one-cluster));
- the statement is a `SELECT`, past any leading whitespace and comments. A `DELETE` never gets a second
  engine;
- the dialect declares a legacy engine. Only OpenSearch's row does; **Elasticsearch never falls back**,
  because its `format=json` *is* its primary engine.

The search response becomes the ordinary result shape: the columns are the **union of every document's
`_source` keys in first-seen order**, a document missing a field reads `null` there, and values are
served verbatim — an object field stays the sub-document the new engine also serves
([§5.3](#53-a-container-field-comes-back-as-its-sub-document)), and the custom-format date stays the
string the document holds. The statement is sent **unchanged**, so the `LIMIT n` / `LIMIT n OFFSET m` the
shared limiter wrote ([§5.5](#55-offset-works-here-which-is-why-paging-does)) is what bounds the rows,
exactly as on the new engine. Table browsing and "Select Top 50 Documents" run through the same
`query()`, so they are covered by the same path; a `COUNT(*)` reads no date value and is not affected.

The result carries **one warning** — the only one this provider ever raises (§5.2) — saying the legacy SQL
engine served it because the index has a custom-format date field, and quoting the new engine's refusal.

**When the legacy engine cannot help** — the statement is not a `SELECT`, the second request fails, or its
answer is not rows (an aggregation answers `aggregations` beside `hits`; a hit with no `_source`) — the
**new engine's** refusal is raised, never the legacy engine's, because that one describes a request the
user never sent. It keeps the engine's own words and gains a hint:

```text
Construct ExprTimestampValue from "2026-09-12 23:59:59.854" failed, unsupported date format. This index maps a date field with a custom format, which this OpenSearch SQL engine cannot read. Select specific columns that leave the custom-format date fields out.
```

The one exception is a deadline or a cancellation that lands during the second request, which is
reported as itself ([§3.8](#38-the-deadline-is-the-clients-and-only-the-clients)).

What a legacy answer does **not** give, all stated in the warning:

- **no column types** — the search response declares none, so the grid shows no type labels;
- **no column aliases and no computed expressions** — the legacy engine returns the documents, so
  `SELECT level AS severity` shows `level`, and a computed column does not appear;
- **document field order, not projection order** — `SELECT b, a` lists the columns in the order the
  documents hold them.

Not measured, and so not claimed: whether a `CAST` of the date field gets past the new engine (the
failure is in reading the stored value, so the hint does not suggest it), and which later release reads
custom date formats in the new engine. A cluster that does never raises the fault, so it never reaches
the fallback.

---

## 6. Schema introspection

Everything this provider knows about an index's contents is read through the OBJECT SURFACE, and this
section describes the MAPPING decisions behind it; the surface itself is described below. The flat
two-phase reading that used to open this section was deleted with `getSchema` (#789), and so was its
cost model: a folder of indices is described in ONE `_mapping` request over a comma-joined list, split
only on the cluster's own request-line limit, rather than one request per index at a fixed
concurrency.

| Data | Source |
|---|---|
| Indices (the "tables") | `GET /_cat/indices?format=json&bytes=b` |
| Columns | `GET /<index>/_mapping`, flattened to dotted paths |
| `rowCount` / `size` | `docs.count` / `pri.store.size` from the same listing, **omitted** when the server reported none |
| Indexes | always `[]` |
| Foreign keys | always `[]` |

**The schema comes from the MAPPING, not from SQL.** Two independent reasons, and the second is
specific to this product: `SELECT *` describes the *statement* rather than the index, and the two
products do not even agree on what it describes — measured, `SELECT *` here returns the container
fields with their sub-documents while upstream expands the same mapping to its leaves only, and can
answer with no columns at all when a mapping has nothing but containers and unsupported types
([§5.3](#53-a-container-field-comes-back-as-its-sub-document)). A tree built on that
would differ per product for the same index. The mapping is the index's own declaration, is readable on
a closed index, and is the document the user edits.

**System indices are the thing to know about this product.** Measured on a stock 3.8.0 cluster with two
probe indices created by hand, `_cat/indices` listed **four**:

```
.plugins-ml-config              (engine bookkeeping, dot-prefixed)
probe_orders                    (the user's)
probe_shapes                    (the user's)
top_queries-2026.08.18-74305    (engine bookkeeping, NO leading dot)
```

On an *empty* cluster two of three indices are the engine's. The dot convention catches the first and
**not** the second, so the transport carries a second rule for the date-suffixed query-insights shape
(`/^top_queries-\d{4}\.\d{2}\.\d{2}-\d+$/`,
[http-transport.ts:264](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)) — which makes this a
judgement rather than a rule, and is why the seam exposes a **flag** the provider decides about
(`isSystemIndex()`, [introspect.ts:156](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/introspect.ts)) rather
than a filter applied on the wire. Hiding them is what the object surface does: `isSystemIndex()` is consulted for every listing and
count, so a folder's badge and its rows agree about what is shown. An operator debugging ML inference
would want `.plugins-ml-config` in the tree and a developer writing a query would not, and nothing in
the surface expresses that choice today; the flag is where it would be made.

Note also that `top_queries-2026.08.18-74305` carries hyphens and dots, so it is a name SQL needs
quoted. `DatabaseObject.name` is the index name **verbatim** — quoting belongs to whoever builds a
statement, not to the inventory ([introspect.ts:324-336](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/introspect.ts)) —
and on this product the quote character is a **backtick** ([§5.4](#54-dialect-traps-a-user-will-hit)).

**The flattening.** `flattenProperties()`
([http-transport.ts:776](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)) descends both
`properties` (objects) and `fields` (multi-fields), emitting containers, leaves and dotted children:
for `probe_shapes` that is `address`/object, `address.city`/keyword, `items`/nested, `items.sku`/keyword,
`note`/text, `note.keyword`/keyword. The output set is specified by the upstream product's own
`DESCRIBE` (measured, [elasticsearch.md §6](./elasticsearch.md#6-schema-introspection)), because that
is the stricter of the two surfaces and a column list valid there is valid here. Nothing outside
`properties` is read — measured, this product's own `.plugins-ml-config` mapping carries a sibling
`_meta` object at the same level, which is metadata about the mapping rather than a field in it.

**Containers are not columns; a multi-field parent is.** `SEARCH_CONTAINER_TYPES = ["object",
"nested"]` ([introspect.ts:90](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/introspect.ts)) are dropped, and
this is the one place the provider is deliberately **stricter than this engine allows**: upstream
refuses `SELECT address` outright, this product answers it with the sub-document, and
`query-generators.ts` builds its starter query by enumerating every declared column. Projecting the
leaves works on both; listing the container would hand an Elasticsearch user a query that cannot run at
all. A `text` field with a `keyword` sub-field is **kept** as a column, because its own type is not a
container type and both `note` and `note.keyword` are separately queryable.

**Every column is nullable and none is primary**
([introspect.ts:195](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/introspect.ts)):

- `nullable: true` is a measurement. A mapping declares how a field is indexed *if* a document carries
  it; there is no `NOT NULL` in the model, and a document indexed without a field comes back as `null`.
- `isPrimary: false` always. Nothing a mapping declares is unique — indexing the same body twice
  yields two documents — and the only unique thing in an index is `_id`, which is metadata rather than
  a mapped field. **This product does expose `_id` in SQL** while upstream does not, so treating it as
  a key here would also make the two type-ids disagree about the same index. And `isPrimary` is stated
  as *fact* wherever it is read: `sql-completions.ts` appends "(PK)", the agent's schema context puts
  " PK" into what a model reasons from, and `schema-diff` reports "Primary key changed" — a key
  invented here becomes a key the product asserts. `ColumnSchema` has no "document identity" field, and
  inventing one out of `isPrimary` would be a different concept wearing its name.
- `defaultValue` is left undefined. A mapping's `null_value` is not a default: it is the term
  substituted into the *index* for an explicit null so the value becomes searchable, and it changes no
  value any document carries.

**Column order is sorted by path**, by code unit, not by the server's order and not by locale
([introspect.ts:244](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/introspect.ts)): a mapping has no
declaration order to preserve, because documents are unordered JSON. Sorting by path also keeps
`address.city` and `items.sku` next to their siblings once the containers are dropped.

**A closed index is kept, and reads honestly**: its `_cat` row reports the status word **`close`** (not
"closed") with `docs.count` and `pri.store.size` as JSON `null`, while `_mapping` still answers in
full. So it is described completely with `rowCount` and `size` **omitted** rather than zeroed —
The object shape makes both optional, which is what preserves the distinction.

**A mapping the cluster did not answer for is REPORTED, not degraded to an empty column list**, and
that is a change from the deleted reading (#789). A concrete `_mapping` request answers for every name
it was given, a CLOSED index included, and refuses the whole request for a name that does not exist, so
a name missing from a present answer cannot have come from the engine and `describeObjects` throws
naming the index. **This is where the two fault vocabularies still matter**: a missing index reported
by `_mapping` is snake_case `index_not_found_exception` while the SQL endpoint says
`IndexNotFoundException`, and both are in the transport's fault table
([http-transport.ts](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)). A live probe of
`mapping()` is what caught that; the SQL fixtures alone would have left a missing index reported as an
engine fault.

### The object surface (#789)

The schema reader above describes **indices and nothing else**. The object browser's four methods -
`listContainers`, `countObjects`, `listObjects`, `describeObject` - read four further REST endpoints,
and **none of these objects is reachable from the SQL endpoint at all**: neither product's grammar has
a `CREATE` statement for any of them, and OpenSearch's has none of any kind. This is the first
provider in #789 whose objects come from REST rather than from a catalog query.

**Zero container levels.** An index is not inside anything, and both products' own SQL surfaces say
so: OpenSearch answers `TABLE_SCHEM` **null** and Elasticsearch reports only a `catalog` that is the
cluster name and is not addressable in a statement (both measured, [§3](#3-design-decisions)). So
`listContainers()` answers `[]` without a round trip and the tree opens straight onto the kind
folders; first paint costs one `countObjects` and no container walk.

| Kind | Role | Source | Filter |
|---|---|---|---|
| `index` | relation, accepts row writes | `GET /_cat/indices?format=json&bytes=b` | dot prefix, plus OpenSearch's date-suffixed `top_queries-*` |
| `alias` | relation | `GET /_alias`, flattened and deduplicated | dot prefix or `_meta.managed` |
| `stream` | relation | `GET /_data_stream` | dot prefix or `_meta.managed` |
| `pipeline` | config | `GET /_ingest/pipeline` | dot prefix or `_meta.managed` |
| `template` | config | `GET /_index_template` | dot prefix or `_meta.managed` |

The last four all run the same predicate, `isEngineOwned()` in
[`http-transport.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts): a dot prefix **or**
`_meta.managed`, on every one of them. Only the `index` row is different, and only because `_cat`
publishes no `_meta` at all, so a name shape is the only signal there is. An alias and a data stream
carry no `_meta` on either product today, which makes the second half of the rule inert for those two
rather than absent - and writing "dot prefix" for them would describe a filter the code does not run.

**An alias and a data stream are RELATIONS, not config objects, and that is measured.** Both answer
rows through the SQL endpoint on both products: `SELECT customer FROM probe_orders_alias` returns the
row and `SELECT * FROM probe_stream` returns the column list (2026-09-11). Neither declares
`acceptsRowWrites`: an alias may span several indices and has no single write target, a data stream is
append-only through its own API, and in any case no statement this provider can send writes anything.

**A data stream is a kind rather than a property of an index, and the reason is that the alternative
hides it completely.** Its backing indices are `.ds-`-prefixed, which the index listing's own system
rule already removes, so without this kind a data stream's data is reachable through nothing in the
tree at all - and, the other half of the same fact, declaring both kinds counts nothing twice. Both
`_cat/indices` fixtures carry a `.ds-` backing-index row so that premise is asserted rather than
argued: the `index` folder does not list it and the `stream` folder holds one object.

**The count and the listing are the same call.** Standing ruling 5f says the listing must contain
exactly what the count counted; on a SQL engine those drift apart in a second `WHERE` clause, and here
there is no `WHERE` clause, so the place they could stop being the same call is **the HTTP request
itself**. `readKind()` in [`search/index.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts) is the
only place a REST listing becomes objects: `countObjects` is its length per kind and `listObjects` is
its result for one kind, through the same read, the same system filter, the same path construction and
the same sort. A refusal is **per kind**, not per cluster - these are four separate endpoints and a
security plugin grants privileges per endpoint - so one refused folder carries the engine's own
sentence and the other four still count.

**An alias listing is keyed by INDEX and has to be flattened and deduplicated.** The payload is
`{"<index>":{"aliases":{"<alias>":{}}}}`, an index with no alias is still listed with an empty map,
and one alias over several indices is named once per index (measured: adding `shared_alias` to two
indices lists it twice). The tree addresses an alias by name, so without the dedupe that folder holds
two rows at one path. An alias can never collide with an index or a data stream: `POST /_aliases`
adding an alias called `probe_orders` while that index exists is refused with *"an index or data
stream exists with the same name as the alias"* on both products.

**The engine's own objects are filtered on two signals, because neither is sufficient.** Measured on a
stock Elasticsearch 9.1.4 node on 2026-09-11: 21 ingest pipelines, all `_meta.managed: true` and
**none** dot-prefixed; 61 composable index templates, 57 managed and the remaining four
(`.monitoring-*-mb`) dotted and unmanaged. A dot-only rule leaves every pipeline in, a managed-only
rule leaves four templates in. The cost is the one the index listing already pays and it is stated
rather than hidden: a user **can** create a dot-prefixed alias or template (measured, acknowledged),
and this hides it. Elasticsearch's data streams also carry a `system` boolean and OpenSearch's carry
none; it is deliberately **not** read, because every engine-owned data stream that could be measured
is dot-prefixed and a second rule no fixture can distinguish from the first is a line nothing proves.

**`GET /_ingest/pipeline` answers HTTP 404 with `{}` when the cluster holds no pipeline**, and the
transport reads that as an empty set rather than a failure. It is the one status outside the 401/403
pair that decides anything here, and it is not generalised: `_alias`, `_index_template` and
`_data_stream` all answer HTTP 200 with an empty collection when they hold nothing, so a 404 from
those really would be something else.

Measured on **both** products on 2026-09-11, and upstream the state had to be made rather than found.
A stock Elasticsearch node ships 21 managed ingest pipelines, so `DELETE /_ingest/pipeline/*` was sent
first (HTTP 200, `{"acknowledged":true}`); `GET /_ingest/pipeline` then answered HTTP 404 with `{}` on
Elasticsearch 9.1.4 exactly as it does on a stock OpenSearch 3.8.0 node, which ships none and reaches
the state on its first run. Elasticsearch re-registers its built-ins within about twenty seconds, so
the state is transient there and ordinary on the fork - but it is reachable on both, which is what
licenses one rule for one implementation serving two type-ids.

**A status alone cannot tell an empty set from a refusal, so the body decides.** A missing plugin, an
endpoint a security role may not read and an index-shaped 404 all answer 404 too, and each of those
would badge the folder **0** where the truth is a refusal - the exact confusion `KindCount` carries
both a `count` and an `unavailable` state to prevent. The distinguishing signal is already on the wire:
an empty set carries `{}` and nothing else, while a genuine failure carries the error envelope the
transport categorises everywhere else (measured on both, `GET /_data_stream/nope` answers HTTP 404
with `index_not_found_exception`, *"no such index [nope]"*). So the request helper reads the body
before it trusts the status, and a 404 carrying that envelope reaches the folder as the engine's own
sentence rather than as a zero.

**A listing entry this client cannot read is refused, never dropped.** An entry that is not an object,
an entry naming itself in no member, and an alias payload member with no alias map all raise rather
than being skipped. A drop would remove the object from the count and from the listing together, so
the two would still agree (ruling 5f) while the badge is short by exactly the objects nobody can see.
The measured licence to refuse is that both products always send the list key (`{"index_templates":[]}`
and `{"data_streams":[]}` on an empty cluster) and always name every entry, and that an index carrying
no alias is listed with a **present**, empty map.

**What is absent, and why each absence is a fact rather than a gap.**

- **No view, function, procedure or trigger.** Neither product's SQL surface has `CREATE VIEW`, and
  OpenSearch's grammar contains no `CREATE` statement of any kind (`CREATE TABLE t (id BIGINT)`
  answers `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`, *"Query must start with SELECT, DELETE, SHOW or
  DESCRIBE"*). Elasticsearch 9.4 adds an **ES|QL views API as a technical preview**, and #789 Phase 2
  answered the question it left open by leaving it out: a preview surface gets no folder, so there is
  no kind and nothing for the source read to read. It would also be a kind only ONE of the two
  products this implementation serves could ever hold, and this one is the other.
- **No stored script.** Both products have them and neither has a list-all API: `GET /_scripts` is
  refused outright (*"Invalid index name [_scripts]"*), only get-by-id exists. An object that cannot be
  enumerated cannot be a tree node - the same call Redis's `EVAL` scripts got.
- **No legacy index template.** `_template` is a separate namespace whose names may **collide** with
  the composable ones: measured on both products, `PUT _template/probe_template` succeeds while a
  composable `probe_template` already exists, so one kind fed by both endpoints would hold two
  different objects at one path.
- **No secondary-index kind** in the relational sense. Every mapped field is inverted-indexed as a
  property of being mapped, so there is nothing a user declared and nothing to name; `index` here is
  the engine's own word for what a table is.

`describeObject(path, kind)` answers the **mapping** for an `index`, an `alias` and a `stream` - an
alias resolves to the index behind it and a data stream to its current backing index, both keyed by
the concrete index name - and **no columns** for a `pipeline` or a `template`, which is the right
answer rather than a gap: they are JSON documents with no field list, exactly as a routine, a trigger
and a sequence have no columns on the SQL engines. `indexes` and `foreignKeys` are always empty, for
the reasons in the table above.

#### `describeObjects`, the bulk column read (#789)

`describeObjects(container, kind, limit?)` answers columns for every object of one kind, and **which
call it uses depends on the kind**, measured on OpenSearch 3.8.0 on 2026-09-12 rather than assumed:

- An **index** is concrete, so `_mapping` over a comma-joined list comes back keyed by the name that
  was asked for. One request serves a whole folder.
- An **alias** and a **data stream** resolve to the index behind them and come back keyed by **that**
  index. Measured: `GET /probe_orders_alias,alias_two/_mapping`, two aliases on one index, answers a
  single `probe_orders` key, and the fixture's alias answers under the same key as the index itself.
  Nothing in that payload attributes a mapping back to the alias it was asked for, so those stay one
  request per object, issued in parallel and cut by the caller's `limit` first.
- A **pipeline** and a **template** answer `{ details: [] }` with no round trip at all, the same
  fact `describeObject` states by answering three empty arrays.

**The bulk request is chunked, and the bound is the cluster's own.** Measured on OpenSearch 3.8.0: a `_mapping`
request whose index list is 3,999 characters answers HTTP 200 and one of 4,499 answers HTTP 400,
`too_long_http_line_exception`, "An HTTP line is larger than 4096 bytes." The limit is on the whole
request line, so the transport splits the names into request-line-sized chunks by BYTES rather than
by a count - an index name may be up to 255 bytes - and issues as many requests as that needs.
Splitting drops nothing, so it is **not** reported as truncation.

| Shape | Requests | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One `describeObjects` over the fixture's 2 indices | 2 | 4 ms |
| The 2 `describeObject` calls it replaces | 4 | 8 ms |

**One mapper, shared with the single read.** `searchObjectDetail()` builds both, so a batch cannot
spell an object differently from `describeObject` on the same name. Verified live on both products:
for every index, alias and data stream, the batch's detail is identical to the single read's.

**A name the cluster answered nothing for is named, never described as empty.** A concrete `_mapping`
request answers for every name it was given - a closed index included, measured - and refuses the
whole request for one that does not exist, so a name missing from a present answer cannot come from
the engine. Reporting it as a mapping-less index would spell it exactly like an index that really has
no mapping, which is an ordinary state.

**The bound is the caller's, and there is no `limit + 1`.** Every listing is one REST call answering
the cluster's whole set, so the target set is complete before anything is cut and the comparison is
exact. The cut is applied in code after the shared `comparePaths` sort, which makes a bounded read's
membership this provider's rather than the server's: no listing endpoint here takes an order or a
limit at all.

**The fixture is `docker/search-init/01-object-fixture.sh` and it applies unchanged to both
products.** Neither image has an init-script directory, so it is a script rather than a file the
entrypoint runs. `database-compose.yml` mounts the directory read-only into both services at
`/opt/search-init`, so it is applied either from the repo or from inside the container:

```bash
SEARCH_URL=http://localhost:9200 bash docker/search-init/01-object-fixture.sh
docker exec libredb-elasticsearch bash /opt/search-init/01-object-fixture.sh
docker exec libredb-opensearch    bash /opt/search-init/01-object-fixture.sh
```

It creates one instance of every declared kind: the index `probe_orders`, the alias
`probe_orders_alias`, the ingest pipeline `probe_pipeline`, the composable index templates
`probe_template` and `probe_stream_template`, and the data stream `probe_stream`. It creates two more
ingest pipelines for the source read (#789), each carrying a claim this doc makes: `probe_json_edges`
holds the values a JSON re-serialisation changes, and `probe pipe/slash` is named so that the
percent-encoding is exercised by an object rather than by an argument. The script's own header says
what each object is for.

**The one measured difference between the two products, and it is not in the declaration.** The
object surface's five kinds, their roles, their paths and their columns were driven against a live
OpenSearch 3.8.0 node and a live Elasticsearch 9.1.4 node on 2026-09-11 with the same fixture applied,
and the output was identical kind for kind, path for path and column for column. What differs is what
a **stock** cluster already holds: this product ships **no** ingest pipeline and **no** composable
index template at all, so a fresh cluster's `GET /_ingest/pipeline` really does answer HTTP 404 - that
is the ordinary first-run state here, while upstream, where 21 managed pipelines ship, the same state
has to be MADE by deleting them and lasts only the twenty seconds or so before Elasticsearch
re-registers its own. A transport that classified on the status would put the engine's own refusal
sentence on the Ingest Pipelines folder of every fresh OpenSearch cluster, where the truth is zero. The index filter
also has more to do here for a second measured reason: a stock node ships `.plugins-ml-config`,
`.opensearch-sap-log-types-config` and `top_queries-<date>-<n>`, and the last carries no dot at all.
See [elasticsearch.md](elasticsearch.md) for the other half of that sentence.

#### Object source (#789)

`readObjectSource(path, kind, limit?)` answers **one part** holding one object's definition, and two
of the five kinds declare it: `pipeline` and `template`, both `sourceLanguage: "json"`. ONE
declaration constant, `SEARCH_OBJECT_KINDS`, serves both type-ids, so this section and
[elasticsearch.md](elasticsearch.md) describe the same code - and every claim below was measured on
**this** product, on OpenSearch 3.8.0 on 2026-09-13, rather than carried over.

| Kind | Request | The text | `form` | `origin` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pipeline` | `GET /_ingest/pipeline/<name>` | the value under the `<name>` key | `complete` | `rendered` |
| `template` | `GET /_index_template/<name>` | the `index_template` of the entry whose `name` matches | `complete` | `rendered` |

**Why `index`, `alias` and `stream` declare nothing.**

- **`index`.** `GET /<index>` answers settings the **server** wrote - `index.uuid`, `creation_date`,
  `version.created`, `provided_name` - so what a Source tab would show is not a definition anybody
  could re-apply, and the round trip from that answer back to a `PUT` that recreates the index could
  not be established.
- **`alias`.** One alias over N indices has **one definition per index** and a different create shape
  (`POST /_aliases` with an actions array), while the tree deliberately deduplicates those N rows to
  one object. There is no single text belonging to the row that exists.
- **`stream`.** A data stream's definition **is** the matching index template, which is a different
  object in a different folder of the same tree. Showing it here would present another object's
  definition as this one's.

**The definition is unwrapped, and the key is matched EXACTLY.** A pipeline arrives as
`{"<name>": {...}}` and a template as `{"index_templates":[{"name":..., "index_template":{...}}]}`, so
rendering the answer would show a reader a wrapper around the thing they opened. Taking "the only
key" or entry zero instead is worse, and the reason is measured on this product: a `*` in the name is
a **wildcard** on both endpoints, `GET /_ingest/pipeline/probe*` answers HTTP 200 carrying
`probe_pipeline`, `GET /_index_template/probe*` answers **two** entries, and `%2A` is decoded before
the match so encoding does not help. The read therefore takes the value under the exact name asked
for, and a name the answer does not carry is an **absence**.

**Absence RAISES, and the two endpoints spell it differently.** `GET /_ingest/pipeline/no_such`
answers HTTP **404** with the body `{}` and `GET /_index_template/no_such` answers HTTP **404** with
the **full error envelope** (`resource_not_found_exception`, *"index template matching [no_such] not
found"*, in the core REST layer's snake_case rather than the SQL plugin's Java class names). Both mean
the object is not there, so absence is decided on the **status** for a named object and the read
raises a `QueryError` naming it. That is deliberately not the rule the listings follow: a listing's
404 has a second meaning here more than anywhere, because a stock node with no pipeline answers it,
so a listing may read a 404 as empty only while the body is a payload.

**Only an answer from the cluster is a refusal.** A denied endpoint, a fault the cluster named, or a
body this client could not read becomes a refusal part carrying the cluster's own sentence,
unprefixed - with one exception, the **denial**, whose sentence the transport composes from the
status because no 401 or 403 body could be captured (see CANNOT below). A dropped socket, an expired
client deadline and a cancellation **raise** instead: nobody answered, and *"connect ECONNREFUSED"*
printed in the Source pane as this object's own refusal has no raise, nothing to retry and nothing
distinguishing it from a real denial. All eight arms of that split are driven in the two integration
suites, and `unsupported` is driven from THIS suite because it is this product's fault table that
carries a name mapping to it (`SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`).

**An unreadable body is a refusal and never an absence.** Where the answer is HTTP 200 and is not the
shape this client parses - the wrapper is not an object, the value under the name is not an object,
`index_templates` is not an array, an entry carries no `name` - the read reports *"OpenSearch answered
an ingest pipeline definition the client could not read"* (or *"an index template definition"*).
Skipping the entry or reading it as nothing would say *"No OpenSearch template named X"* about a row
the tree is currently showing, which is a claim about the cluster where the truth is a claim about
this client.

**An EMPTY definition cannot arrive, measured rather than assumed.** Design guarantee 2 asks for a
refusal part where an engine answers empty or whitespace-only text, and neither endpoint here can
produce one: `PUT /_ingest/pipeline/<id>` with `{}` is HTTP **400** (`parse_exception`, *"[processors]
required property is missing"*) and `PUT /_index_template/<name>` with `{}` is HTTP **400**
(`illegal_argument_exception`, *"Required [index_patterns]"*). The smallest definitions either
endpoint stores are `{"processors":[]}` and `{"index_patterns":["..."]}`, both `PUT` 200 and both read
back with those members - and this product answers the minimal template back verbatim where
Elasticsearch adds `"composed_of": []` to it. So the rendered text is always a JSON object with at
least one member. Measured on 3.8.0 on 2026-09-13 and re-runnable with those `PUT`s.

**A refusal is per ENDPOINT.** These are two separate endpoints and the security plugin grants
privileges per endpoint, so a pipeline read can be denied while a template read answers.

**Neither refusal can be produced on the compose service: CANNOT.** `DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN` is
`true` there, a bogus `Basic` header is IGNORED and the cluster answers HTTP 200 (measured
2026-09-13), so no 401 or 403 body exists to capture from this container, and enabling the plugin
would change the image configuration every other measurement here rests on. The suite drives the
refusal shape instead, and a denied read carries `"OpenSearch refused the credentials (HTTP 403)"`.

**The name is percent-encoded.** A pipeline name may hold a space **and** a slash on this product too
(both `PUT` 200), and `GET /_ingest/pipeline/probe%20pipe%2Fslash` answers the object. The escaper is
`encodeURIComponent`, and `docker/search-init/01-object-fixture.sh` creates `probe pipe/slash` so the
escaping is exercised by an object rather than by an argument. A template name may **not** hold a
space, so the pipeline endpoint is the only place such an object can exist.

**What the renderer does to the cluster's bytes, measured, because `origin: "rendered"` is a promise
about exactly this.** There is no extended-JSON writer for a REST payload, and the definition is a
sub-document of the answer rather than the answer, so the text cannot be the bytes the cluster sent.
It is `JSON.parse` followed by `JSON.stringify` with a two-space indent, and three things change.
Measured on 3.8.0 on 2026-09-13 against the fixture's `probe_json_edges` pipeline:

| The cluster answered | This product renders |
|---|---|
| `9223372036854775807` | `9223372036854776000` |
| `1.0E30` | `1e+30` |
| a map keyed `zz, 10, 2, aa` | the same map keyed `2, 10, zz, aa` |

Nothing is **dropped** - every value is present, which is what keeps `form: "complete"` true - but a
long past 2^53 loses precision, an exponent is re-spelled, and integer-like keys are hoisted ahead of
the others by JavaScript's own property order. A definition holding such a value must not be copied
out of the Source pane and `PUT` back unread.

**One fixture line, two different definitions, and this is the product difference the source read
adds.** `docker/search-init/01-object-fixture.sh` writes `"data_stream": {}` into
`probe_stream_template` on both products, and each expands it its own way: this one answers
`"data_stream":{"timestamp_field":{"name":"@timestamp"}}` and Elasticsearch answers
`"data_stream":{"hidden":false,"allow_custom_routing":false}` (both measured 2026-09-13). So the two
integration suites pin **different** expected texts for that object on purpose. The other measured
difference is the one this section's neighbours already record: this product also refuses `_meta` on
an ingest pipeline outright (*"pipeline [probe_json_edges] doesn't support one or more provided
configuration parameters [_meta]"*, HTTP 400) where Elasticsearch accepts it, which is why the
fixture's integer-like keys live inside a processor's value.

**The bound is the caller's**, applied through the shared `applySourceBound`, and a text that fits is
never marked.

---

#### Object edit (#789)

This engine is a REFUSAL, and the reason is that the READ is lossy, which makes any write back a rewrite dressed as an edit.
The pane re-serialises the cluster's JSON rather than echoing it: a long past 2^53 comes back re-spelled, `1.0E30` becomes `1e+30`, and map key order changes (D61).
Sending that text back would apply changes the author never made, on fields they never touched, which is a success that destroys something the user was not shown.
The same measurement is why the plan digest this phase added is a hand-written length-framed walk and never `JSON.stringify`.
No kind here declares `acceptsSourceEdits`, and `tests/isolated/object-edit-declarations.test.ts` is what holds that absence and this section together: one declaration constant serves this id and `elasticsearch`, so the two rows of the census always move together.

## 7. Monitoring & health

Every read goes through `guarded()`
([`search/index.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)), which maps a seam failure onto this
repo's error classes ([§10](#10-error-handling)). The only read allowed to fail quietly is the
cluster-wide store size ([§7.1](#71-the-one-swallowed-failure)).

Every method in the table lives in that file and is cited **by name, not by line**: the line
numbers this table used to carry had drifted, and a method name is greppable and stays true.

| Method | Source | Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| `getOverview()` | `/`, `_cluster/health`, `_cat/indices` — **three seam calls in parallel** | `version` = `"OpenSearch <number>"`; `uptime` = **`"N/A"`**; `activeConnections` = **absent**; `maxConnections` = **0**; `databaseSize(Bytes)` = the cluster's store from `_cluster/stats`, the **byte key absent** when the cluster publishes no size; `tableCount` = **user** indices only; `indexCount` = **0** |
| `getPerformanceMetrics()` | — | **`{}`**, and it asks the cluster nothing |
| `getSlowQueries()` | — | **`[]`** — and on this product that is a *choice*, not an absence. See below |
| `getIndexStats()` | — | **`[]`**. No secondary-index object exists |
| `getActiveSessions()` | — | **`[]`**. A request is one HTTP request; there is no session and no connection catalog |
| `getTableStats()` | `_cat/indices` | one row per **user** index: `rowCount` = `docs.count`, `tableSize(Bytes)` = `totalSize(Bytes)` = `pri.store.size`, `schemaName` = `""`; `tableSize(Bytes)` **omitted** when the index published no size ([§7](#7-monitoring--health)) |
| `getStorageStats()` | `_cluster/health` + `_cluster/stats` | **one row for the cluster**: `name` = `cluster_name`, `sizeBytes` = `indices.store.size_in_bytes`. **No row at all** when the size was unreported |
| `getHealth()` | the above, composed | `databaseSize`; `activeConnections` **omitted**, carrying the overview's absence across; `cacheHitRatio` = the repo's word for "not measured"; `slowQueries` = `[]`; `activeSessions` = `[]` |

**The slow-query panel is empty even though this product keeps top-N queries.** That is the sharpest
"deliberately unused" decision in the provider: a stock 3.8.0 node ships a `top_queries-<date>` index —
this provider *hides* it as engine bookkeeping ([§6](#6-schema-introspection)) — while upstream writes
its slow log to a node **log file** that no API returns. Reading it would be a monitoring surface that
exists on one of two products behind one code path, i.e. exactly the branch on product identity that
the seam and `CLAUDE.md` both forbid. **A slow-query panel populated for half the connections of one
provider type is worse than an honest empty one**
(the comment over `getSlowQueries()` in [`search/index.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)).

**Two vocabulary collisions, both counted wrong by the obvious reading:**

- **`tableCount` counts INDICES** — an index *is* the table here — and counts only the user's, matching
  what the schema tree shows by default. On the measured cluster that is 2 of 4; counting everything
  would report a cluster holding data nobody put there.
- **`indexCount` is 0 and stays 0.** There is no secondary-index *object*: every mapped field is
  inverted-indexed as a property of being mapped. The schema tree says the same from the other side
  with `indexes: []`.

**`databaseSizeBytes` is the CLUSTER's store including replicas**, while the per-index sizes are
**primaries only** (`pri.store.size`, chosen deliberately by `CAT_FIELDS.PRIMARY_SIZE` in
[`http-transport.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)), so they do not sum to
it — and `_cluster/stats` is the one place in this transport where a count arrives as a real JSON
**number** (`indices.store.size_in_bytes`, measured unquoted on both products) rather than a quoted
string.

**An unpublished store size is an absent key, not a 0.** `databaseSizeBytes` is optional, and
`getOverview()` omits it whenever `_cluster/stats` reported nothing
([§7.1](#71-the-one-swallowed-failure)) — it used to pair a `0` with the `"N/A"` its own
`databaseSize` printed from the same input, one object making two different claims.
`StorageTab.tsx` keys its refusal off the missing key, so the Storage tab now draws that refusal
instead of a `0 B` total with a 0.0% breakdown under it. A cluster that really stores nothing
publishes a real `0` and keeps it.

The honest empties, each with its reason:

- **`getPerformanceMetrics()` returns `{}`, not zeroes**, and this is load-bearing. `cacheHitRatio` is
  scored `direction: "below"` with `critical: 80` by `DEFAULT_THRESHOLDS`, so a "neutral" 0 would paint
  a red critical cache fault on every healthy cluster; the monitoring tabs default an **absent** ratio
  to a healthy 100 instead. Every other metric would read as a measurement of zero — and **the tabs did
  read them that way** until the rule #448 settled for the Storage tab reached them: measured
  2026-08-19 on this product, the Overview showed *Buffer Pool 0%* and *Deadlocks 0* for two fields
  this payload omits. Both cards now read `N/A` beside *Not measured*, so the empty payload survives to
  the screen. The numbers exist on this product's stats endpoints, so this is a recorded gap rather
  than an impossibility.
- **`getSlowQueries()` and `getActiveSessions()` return `[]` rather than throwing.** Nothing is broken
  and nothing is misconfigured, so a monitoring tab should render as quiet, not as failed. Only
  `runMaintenance()` throws, because that one is a *request to act*.
- **`activeConnections` is absent, not 0.** The cluster counts open HTTP connections per node in its
  stats API, which is not one of this seam's five calls, and the shard and node counts that *are* here
  would be a different number wearing this field's name — so nothing is knowable, and the field is
  optional precisely so that can be said. `getHealth()` carries the missing key across rather than
  filling it in, and `OverviewTab.tsx` renders the Connections card as `N/A` over *not published*
  with no share of the limit, instead of a `0` under a healthy tick. This provider held the last
  unconditional `activeConnections: 0` in the codebase - SQL Server, Oracle, MongoDB and Cassandra had
  already omitted it - but not the last zero of any kind: Trino, Druid, ClickHouse and Couchbase each
  degrade an unavailable monitoring read to no rows and then map the absent row to 0 (BACKLOG D51).
- **`maxConnections` is 0, and that is the correct encoding** — the opposite one, for the opposite
  reason: for the ceiling `0` and absence are the **same** fact, which is why Druid and Trino cite
  `mssql.ts` for it and why the Connections card reads a zero maximum as "no limit published" rather
  than dividing by it.
- **`uptime` is `"N/A"`.** No call in this seam carries one; a `"0s"` would claim the cluster booted
  this instant.

**A closed index zeroes only the *required* `getTableStats()` fields, and omits the optional ones.**
`TableStats.rowCount`, `totalSize` and `totalSizeBytes` are required numbers, so for those three a
closed index has nowhere to read but zero. `tableSize` and `tableSizeBytes` are *optional*, so they
are **absent** rather than `0`: a zero there would be a fabricated measurement rather than a forced
one. The schema tree makes the same distinction with its own optional `DatabaseObject.rowCount` and
`size` (the comment over `toTableStats()` in
[`search/index.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)).

**One closed index takes the Data figure away from the whole cluster**, and that cost is deliberate.
`StorageTab` gates that figure on `tables.every((t) => t.tableSizeBytes !== undefined)`, so as soon
as one index publishes no size the Tables card reads **N/A** for every open index beside it instead
of a sum over the indices that did answer. A partial sum would read as a measurement of the cluster,
which is the same lie the `0 B` it replaced told about the one index, one digit larger. The
open-beside-closed pair is pinned in
[`opensearch-provider.test.ts`](../../tests/integration/db/opensearch-provider.test.ts) so the
aggregate is asserted, not inferred.

**Document counts exceed what a `SELECT` returns when a mapping has `nested` fields**, and this was
measured here: `probe_shapes` reports **2** documents in `_cat/indices` while `SELECT COUNT(*)` answers
**1**, because every nested element is stored as a document of its own. The panel reports the cluster's
document count — which is what a "row" is on this surface — not the number of rows a query produces, so
an index with nested fields always reads higher here than in the editor. Deriving it from SQL instead
would mean a statement per index, on a surface whose grammar the tree must not depend on, to answer a
different question than the panel asks.

### 7.1 The one swallowed failure

`_cluster/stats` is heavier and more privileged than `_cluster/health`, so a cluster that answers
health and refuses stats is an ordinary configuration. `storeSizeBytes()`
([`http-transport.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)) therefore catches
its own failure and returns `null` — the seam's "unknown" — because losing the health status over a
missing byte count would blank a panel that already had the important number. Its null then propagates
honestly: `getOverview()` shows `"N/A"` for the size **and omits `databaseSizeBytes`**, and
`getStorageStats()` returns **no row at all** rather than a row claiming the cluster stores zero
bytes.

---

## 8. Maintenance

**There is none.** `supportsMaintenance` is `false` and `maintenanceOperations` is `[]`, so no
maintenance control renders for this connection: `TablesTab.tsx` reads the connected provider's
capabilities (#272) and `OperationsTab.tsx` hides the whole Global Operations group where
`supportsMaintenance` is false (#282). That first tab's *Vacuum* summary card reads the same
declaration: it counted rows over a bloat ratio this provider never publishes, so it always said `0`
over a green **OK** — a clean bill of health for an operation named below as impossible here — and it
now says `N/A` over *Not supported*, with a dash in the per-row *Bloat* and *Last Vacuum* cells.

Every `MaintenanceType` is either an index API rather than a statement, or impossible on this surface
altogether:

- `vacuum` / `optimize` / `reindex` / `check` — the nearest analogues are `_refresh`, `_forcemerge`,
  `_reindex` and `_cache/clear`, all **index APIs on the cluster**, none of them a statement this SQL
  surface accepts.
- `analyze` — the cluster maintains its per-shard statistics itself as documents are indexed, and no
  statement recomputes them. (The engine's own `_analyze` is *text analysis*, an entirely different
  operation, which is why the labels below avoid the bare word "Analyze".)
- `kill` — impossible for a second, independent reason: an abort closes this client's socket while the
  cluster keeps working ([§3.8](#38-the-deadline-is-the-clients-and-only-the-clients)), and the task
  API that could really cancel a search is not part of this seam.

`runMaintenance(type)` ([`search/index.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)) exists because
the `DatabaseProvider` interface obliges every provider to implement it, and **not** because a request
reaches it: `/api/db/maintenance` checks `supportsMaintenance` and answers 400 first. So the message
below is what a *programmatic* caller of `@libredb/studio` sees:

> OpenSearch has no SQL-reachable maintenance operation, so "\<type\>" cannot run here. Refreshing,
> merging segments and clearing caches are index APIs on the cluster rather than statements, and a
> running search cannot be cancelled through this surface.

Throwing rather than reporting a cheerful success is the point — a caller that asked for work must not
be told work happened.

## 9. Capabilities & labels

### `getCapabilities()` ([index.ts:388](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts))

One answer for both products, because every flag here measured the same on both. The single
difference — `OFFSET` — has no field in `ProviderCapabilities` to declare it in, so it lives on
`SearchProduct` and is read by `prepareQuery()` alone
([§5.5](#55-offset-works-here-which-is-why-paging-does)).

| Capability | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `queryLanguage` | `sql` | The bundled SQL plugin, present on a stock node ([§3.3](#33-sql-because-there-is-no-esql-here)) |
| `supportsExplain` | **`false`** | The statement form is refused here and the plan lives behind a second endpoint outside this seam ([§3.10](#310-no-explain-the-statement-form-is-refused)) |
| `supportsExternalQueryLimiting` | `true` | **Both** limiter forms are correct here, `LIMIT n` and `LIMIT n OFFSET m` |
| `supportsCreateTable` | **`false`** | Not in the grammar ([§5.6](#56-this-grammar-has-delete-and-it-is-off)) |
| `supportsInlineRowEdit` | **`false`** | `UPDATE` is not in the grammar, so the editor's statement could only ever produce an error (#269) |
| `supportsTransactions` | **`false`** | `BEGIN` is not in the grammar and the surface is stateless HTTP. Measured 2026-08-19 on OpenSearch 3.8.0: `POST /api/db/transaction` answered HTTP 400, *"Transaction control is not supported for this database type"*, for both `begin` and `rollback` — the measurement #U13 came from |
| `declaresForeignKeys` | **`false`** | The engine has no such constraint in its model, so the empty `foreignKeys` means "impossible here" rather than "none declared, or none visible to this role" — the distinction #414 was about |
| `supportsMaintenance` | **`false`** | Nothing in `MaintenanceType` is SQL-reachable ([§8](#8-maintenance)) |
| `maintenanceOperations` | `[]` | Consequence of the above |
| `supportsConnectionString` | **`false`** | No URI convention, and `http(s)://` is ClickHouse's ([§4.2](#42-there-is-no-connection-string-and-that-is-deliberate)) |
| `defaultPort` | `9200` | Both schemes; the fixture publishes 9201 on the host ([§4.1](#41-configuration-fields)) |
| `identifierQuoting` | **`backtick`** | The difference that fails silently: a double-quoted name here is a string literal, so a generated `WHERE "customer" = 'acme'` answers HTTP 200 with no rows ([§5.4](#54-dialect-traps-a-user-will-hit)) |
| `statementTerminator` | **`none`** | Declared even though this product accepts `;`: the absence runs here too, and the upstream grammar has no terminator at all, so one answer serves both ([§5.4](#54-dialect-traps-a-user-will-hit)) |
| `containerLevels` | **`[]`** | An index is not inside anything, and both products' own SQL surfaces say so ([§6](#the-object-surface-789)) |
| `objectKinds` | `index`, `alias`, `stream`, `pipeline`, `template` | The five objects a search cluster publishes over REST; `index` is the only one that accepts row writes ([§6](#the-object-surface-789)) |
| `schemaRefreshPattern` | `\b(DELETE)\b` | **This is the product it exists for**: a cluster with DELETE enabled really changes the counts this provider reports ([§5.6](#56-this-grammar-has-delete-and-it-is-off)) |

`isGroupedKeyspace` is deliberately **absent**: an index is a real object the cluster holds, named by
whoever created it and addressable in a statement — not a grouping a server derived from a scan, which
is what Redis and LibreDB declare.

### `getLabels()` ([index.ts:455](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts))

| Label | Value |
|---|---|
| `entityName` / `entityNamePlural` | **`Index`** / **`Indices`** |
| `rowName` / `rowNamePlural` | **`document`** / **`documents`** |
| `selectAction` | `Select Top 50 Documents` |
| `analyzeAction` / `analyzeGlobalLabel` | `Index Statistics` |
| `vacuumAction` / `vacuumGlobalLabel` | `Merge Segments` |
| `searchPlaceholder` | `Search indices or fields...` |
| `statementLanguage` | `OpenSearch SQL, the SQL plugin's own dialect - NOT the JSON query DSL, NOT an aggregation body, and NOT PPL` |
| `slowQueriesEmptyState` | `The slow log is written to the node's own log file, which no API returns, so this SQL surface does not reach it.` |

`statementLanguage` is the one label written for a **model** rather than for the UI, and this product's
spelling differs from the upstream one because its alternatives do: the SQL plugin ships **PPL** beside
SQL, and ES|QL does not exist here. The run that made the field necessary was on *this* product — a
plan run answered with a native aggregation body, correct for the cluster and unrunnable through the
SQL endpoint (measured in the browser, 2026-08-19). See
[elasticsearch.md §9](./elasticsearch.md#9-capabilities--labels) for the mechanism, which is shared.

`slowQueriesEmptyState` is the monitoring Queries panel's empty state, and it says what §7 already
says about `getSlowQueries()`. That sentence was hardcoded to PostgreSQL's `pg_stat_statements`
advice on every engine, measured in the browser on 2026-08-19 against **this** panel on a search
connection (#463) - the #427 defect in another panel, and fixed the same way: by
reading the label.

These are not decoration. `inventory-noun.ts` lowercases `entityName` into the noun the **agent**
reasons with, so a cluster described as holding "tables" of "rows" invites statements written for a
relational engine. "Indices" rather than "Indexes" because that is the plural this product's own API and
documentation use — and because "indexes" is the word this codebase already uses for the
secondary-index objects an index does **not** have (`ObjectDetail.indexes`, empty by construction here).

The two maintenance actions are named even though `supportsMaintenance` is false, because they are
still rendered **where an engine has maintenance to run**, and their global descriptions say in words
that nothing runs from here. They are no longer offered in this engine's schema tree: that was a dead
end into a page whose maintenance card is gated on the same capability, and
[`TableItem.tsx`](../../src/components/schema-explorer/TableItem.tsx) now requires both an addressable
row and a declared capability. See
[elasticsearch.md §9](./elasticsearch.md#9-capabilities--labels) for the measurement.

---

## 10. Error handling

The transport normalizes every failure into
`SearchTransportError { category, message, engineType? }`
([transport.ts:153](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/transport.ts)); `mapSearchError()`
([index.ts:671](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)) maps the **category** — never the HTTP
status — onto the shared classes in [`src/lib/db/errors.ts`](../../src/lib/db/errors.ts). Every category
is listed and there is no `default`, so adding one to the seam fails the typecheck here instead of being
quietly swallowed as a query error.

| Category | Measured trigger on this product | Error raised |
|---|---|---|
| `auth` | HTTP 401/403 (status-decided; see [§3.7](#37-a-string-valued-error-means-the-request-never-reached-the-sql-engine)) | `AuthenticationError` |
| `unreachable` | A refused socket, an unresolvable host, or a **string-valued** `error` — the upstream endpoint path (HTTP 405 here), a missing content type (406) | `ConnectionError` carrying host and port |
| `timeout` | The client deadline expired (`AbortSignal.timeout`) | `TimeoutError` — and the cluster is *still working on the statement* |
| `cancelled` | The caller aborted | `QueryCancelledError` |
| `syntax` | `ParserException`, `EOFParserException` (matched by suffix), `NumberFormatException` | `QueryError` |
| `unknown-object` | `IndexNotFoundException` (SQL, 404), `index_not_found_exception` (core REST, 404), `SemanticCheckException` | `QueryError` |
| `unsupported` | `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` — a mistyped leading keyword, every refused mutation, a statement-form `EXPLAIN` | `QueryError` |
| `engine` | `IllegalArgumentException` (duplicate output names), `NullPointerException`, `IllegalStateException` (including the custom-format date refusal the legacy engine could not answer — [§5.8](#58-a-custom-format-date-field-the-legacy-engine-fallback)), any unrecognised fault name, the paging ceiling, an unreadable body | `QueryError` |

The four that collapse onto `QueryError` do so because they describe the same event to a user — the
cluster read the statement and refused it — and the engine's own wording, carried through the seam
verbatim, is what distinguishes them on screen. **`unsupported` is mapped here rather than to a
configuration error for a measured reason**: on this product it is what a *mistyped* leading keyword
answers, which is a statement problem and nothing about the deployment
([index.ts:660-666](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts)).

A value that is **not** a seam error never came from the cluster (an internal defect, an assertion) and
goes to the shared message-based `mapError()`, exactly as `druid/index.ts` and `clickhouse/index.ts`
do.

The `unreachable` message quotes the cause from **both** places a runtime puts it, because this repo
runs on two: on Node a refused socket is `TypeError: fetch failed` whose `cause.code` is
`ECONNREFUSED`, while Bun throws `Error: Unable to connect. Is the computer able to access the url?`
with `code: "ConnectionRefused"` on the error **itself** and no cause at all
([http-transport.ts:677-729](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/http-transport.ts)).

| Situation | Error |
|---|---|
| Missing `host` | `DatabaseConfigError` — "OpenSearch requires a host" |
| Operation before `connect()` | `DatabaseConfigError` (via `ensureConnected()`) |
| `connect()` fails on credentials | `AuthenticationError` — a rejected credential is not a connectivity problem |
| `connect()` fails otherwise | `ConnectionError` — "Failed to connect to OpenSearch: …", carrying the cluster's own words (which for the two commonest mistakes are the useful ones: a refused socket names the code, and the wrong endpoint path is quoted verbatim) |
| `query(sql, params)` with parameters | `QueryError`, raised **before** anything leaves the process ([§3.11](#311-positional-parameters-are-refused-not-emulated)) |
| More result pages than `MAX_PAGES` | `QueryError` naming the ceiling and advising a narrower statement — after the abandoned cursor is closed ([§3.5](#35-paging-the-cursor-is-followed-never-requested)) |

---

## 11. Testing

### 11.1 How the tests work

There is **no `mock.module()` anywhere in the search suite** — it is process-wide in bun and would
poison sibling files.

- [`tests/integration/db/opensearch-provider.test.ts`](../../tests/integration/db/opensearch-provider.test.ts)
  replaces `globalThis.fetch` per test and restores it in `afterEach`, so the real transport, the real
  introspection and the real provider all run — only the cluster is fake. Every payload was captured
  from a live 3.8.0 node (`probe_orders`, `probe_shapes`), so the fake speaks exactly what the server
  speaks. **This file's job is the DIVERGENCE**: one implementation serves two type-ids, the
  Elasticsearch sibling covers what the two share, and what is asserted here is what this product does
  *differently* — the `schema`/`datarows` envelope with its `total`, the separate `alias`, the 404
  missing index, the Java-class fault names beside the one snake_case name from the core REST layer,
  the **refused** duplicate output name, the accepted `OFFSET`, and the system indices the dot rule
  alone does not catch. That is what makes "two type-ids, one implementation" a tested claim rather
  than an assumption.
- [`tests/integration/db/elasticsearch-provider.test.ts`](../../tests/integration/db/elasticsearch-provider.test.ts)
  carries the shared behaviour and the upstream-only measurements (engine-initiated paging with its
  column-less second page, the duplicate-name disambiguation, the 400/500 status inversion).
- [`tests/unit/db/search/introspect.test.ts`](../../tests/unit/db/search/introspect.test.ts) drives
  introspection through a hand-built `SearchTransport` — the payoff of the seam: no `fetch` mocking and
  no server. Its fake's `query()` **throws on purpose**, because introspection reading a statement
  would be a design regression rather than a test failure.
- [`tests/unit/db/search/seam-guard.test.ts`](../../tests/unit/db/search/seam-guard.test.ts) is a
  parser, not a grep, and proves itself in both directions: it must fire on `http-transport.ts` and
  stay silent on a compliant sample before it asserts the provider directory is clean.

### 11.2 Coverage

Validation (host required), capabilities and labels, connect/disconnect including the `SELECT 1` probe
surfacing a wrong endpoint or a rejected credential, query execution and result shaping (the alias
preference, the declared order, the measured duration, the dropped `totalHits`), the full
category-to-error map across **both** fault vocabularies, `prepareQuery()` passing an `OFFSET`
statement through untouched, mapping-driven schema (containers dropped, multi-fields dropped, closed
index, both system-index rules, the degradable per-index failures), every monitoring method and its
empties, and `runMaintenance()` refusing with its reason.

### 11.3 Run it

```bash
bun test tests/integration/db/opensearch-provider.test.ts
bun test tests/unit/db/search

# Full isolated suite (CI-equivalent)
bun run test
```

### 11.4 Optional: reproducing the live pass

The committed tests never touch a cluster. To reproduce the measurements behind this document,
`database-compose.yml` carries the **exact build** this provider was verified against, and deliberately
**no profile** — unlike Druid's block — because these are shipped providers and a plain
`docker compose up` has to be able to reproduce their integration pass:

```bash
docker compose -f database-compose.yml up -d elasticsearch opensearch
```

Both services run together on purpose: every claim this document records is a claim about which of the
two answered differently, and that can only be re-measured side by side. This service publishes
**9201** on the host because both products ship on 9200 in the container.

**Under which licence.** The licence the pinned image ships is **Apache-2.0**:
`/usr/share/opensearch/LICENSE.txt` inside the image is the Apache License, Version 2.0. There is no
subscription tier here to confuse with the software licence, which is the distinction the upstream
product forces
([elasticsearch.md §11.4](./elasticsearch.md#114-optional-reproducing-the-live-pass)), and nothing
in it constrains this provider either way.

Two configuration details are load-bearing:

- `DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN: "true"` — the fork's own switch, **not** the upstream
  `xpack.security.enabled` key, because the plugin is installed rather than a licensed feature.
  Without it the node serves HTTPS with a self-signed certificate and a default admin password, which
  this provider cannot verify ([§4.3](#43-tls)).
- The health check waits for **yellow**, not green: a single node with a replica requested is yellow
  forever, so waiting for green would hang.

The image is pinned, and here the reason is sharper than usual: **the SQL plugin's fault names are Java
class names that its own releases rename**, and the whole classification table
([§3.6](#36-two-fault-vocabularies-in-one-cluster)) is keyed on them.

There is **no seed sidecar**, and one thing to expect instead: a stock node ships its own indices, so
two thirds of an empty cluster's index listing is engine bookkeeping
([§6](#6-schema-introspection)). Seed the probe indices with the document API — there is no
`CREATE TABLE` here:

```bash
curl -s -XPOST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  'http://localhost:9201/probe_orders/_doc?refresh=true' \
  -d '{"id":1,"customer":"acme","total":9.5}'

# an object, a nested array and a multi-field: what §6's flattening and the
# nested-document-count finding are measured against
curl -s -XPUT -H 'content-type: application/json' 'http://localhost:9201/probe_shapes' \
  -d '{"mappings":{"properties":{"address":{"properties":{"city":{"type":"keyword"}}},
                                 "items":{"type":"nested","properties":{"sku":{"type":"keyword"}}},
                                 "note":{"type":"text","fields":{"keyword":{"type":"keyword"}}}}}}'
curl -s -XPOST -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  'http://localhost:9201/probe_shapes/_doc?refresh=true' \
  -d '{"address":{"city":"Ankara"},"items":[{"sku":"A1"}],"note":"hello there"}'
```

`probe_shapes` is the one that matters: one document with one nested element is what makes `_cat`
report **2** while `SELECT COUNT(*)` answers **1** ([§7](#7-monitoring--health)).

---

## 12. Usage examples

### 12.1 Programmatic (via the factory)

```ts
import { createDatabaseProvider } from '@/lib/db/factory';

const provider = await createDatabaseProvider({
  id: 'os1', name: 'OpenSearch', type: 'opensearch',
  host: '127.0.0.1', port: 9201,
  createdAt: new Date(),
});

await provider.connect();                              // proves the port AND the product

const rows   = await provider.query('SELECT * FROM probe_orders LIMIT 50;');   // ';' is fine here
const page2  = await provider.query('SELECT customer FROM probe_orders LIMIT 50 OFFSET 50');
const quoted = await provider.query('SELECT customer FROM `top_queries-2026.08.18-74305`');
const objects = await provider.listObjects(container, 'table');
const { details } = await provider.describeObjects(container, 'table');
const stats  = await provider.getTableStats();         // documents and primary bytes per index

await provider.disconnect();
```

The habit worth keeping is the third line: **backticks, never double quotes**. A double-quoted name is
a string literal here, and in a projection it silently returns the name itself rather than the field
([§5.4](#54-dialect-traps-a-user-will-hit)).

### 12.2 Over the API

`POST /api/db/query` with the statement in the `sql` field — the same contract every SQL provider uses.
`POST /api/db/maintenance` answers 400 before reaching the provider ([§8](#8-maintenance)). The
transaction and cancel routes do not apply: `/api/db/cancel` reports cancellation as unsupported
because the provider exposes no `cancelQuery`
([§3.8](#38-the-deadline-is-the-clients-and-only-the-clients)).

---

## 13. Known limitations & future work

- **No EXPLAIN.** `supportsExplain: false`, so the button and the tab are hidden. `EXPLAIN <select>` as
  a statement is refused here (`SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`), and the plan that *does* exist lives
  behind `POST /_plugins/_sql/_explain` — a second endpoint outside this seam, whose tree shape is not
  what upstream returns either ([§3.10](#310-no-explain-the-statement-form-is-refused)). Widening the
  seam by one call is the concrete follow-up.
- **Aliases and data streams are not listed in the schema tree.** They come from other endpoints
  (`_alias`, `_data_stream`) that this seam does not carry, so a **queryable** alias does not appear in
  the sidebar even though SQL accepts it. Recorded on the seam itself
  ([transport.ts:205-219](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/transport.ts)); the mapping read
  already tolerates the case, taking the single entry of the payload rather than looking it up by the
  requested name, because an alias resolves to the concrete index behind it.
- **No maintenance operations at all** ([§8](#8-maintenance)).
- **No active sessions, and no slow queries** — the second one by choice rather than by absence: this
  product's `top_queries-<date>` index really does hold them, and reading it would populate a panel for
  one of the two type-ids behind one code path ([§7](#7-monitoring--health)).
- **An index whose mapping has `nested` fields reports more documents than a `SELECT` returns.**
  Measured here: `probe_shapes` is 2 documents in `_cat/indices` and 1 row to `SELECT COUNT(*)`
  ([§7](#7-monitoring--health)).
- **`totalHits` is reported by this product and deliberately dropped**, so no surface behaves
  differently between the two type-ids — the upstream product sends no count at all
  ([§5.2](#52-result-shaping)).
- **A trailing semicolon is accepted here and fails upstream.** Recorded because it is a portability
  trap in the other direction: a statement written against this product may not run against the
  sibling type-id, and the shared `generateTableQuery()` output is exactly such a statement
  ([§5.4](#54-dialect-traps-a-user-will-hit)).
- **A double-quoted identifier is silently wrong.** `SELECT "customer"` returns the literal string,
  and `WHERE "customer" = 'acme'` compares two literals and answers 0 rows with no error. The
  codebase's own quoter emits backticks for this dialect
  ([`identifier.ts:36`](../../src/lib/sql/identifier.ts)), but a hand-typed statement has no such
  protection ([§5.4](#54-dialect-traps-a-user-will-hit)).
- **There is a paging ceiling.** A statement whose result the engine spreads over more than
  `MAX_PAGES = 1000` pages is **refused** rather than truncated, after the cursor is closed
  ([§3.5](#35-paging-the-cursor-is-followed-never-requested)).
- **No writes reach documents**, and `DELETE` — the one mutation in this grammar — is off by default
  ([§5.6](#56-this-grammar-has-delete-and-it-is-off)). A field's type cannot be altered in place even
  outside SQL.
- **No positional parameters**, refused rather than inlined
  ([§3.11](#311-positional-parameters-are-refused-not-emulated)).
- **No `cancelQuery`.** An abort bounds this client's wait; the cluster finishes the statement
  ([§3.8](#38-the-deadline-is-the-clients-and-only-the-clients)).
- **Performance metrics are empty**, and this one *is* reachable: the numbers exist on this product's
  stats endpoints, so widening the seam by one call is the concrete follow-up
  ([§7](#7-monitoring--health)).
- **`ssl.caCert` / `ssl.clientCert` / `ssl.rejectUnauthorized` are not honoured**, which matters more
  here than for most providers because a default distribution ships a self-signed certificate
  ([§4.3](#43-tls)).
- **No connection string**, deliberately ([§4.2](#42-there-is-no-connection-string-and-that-is-deliberate)).
- **A type the engine maps but its SQL surface cannot read is still listed as a column**, because the
  mapping does not say which types SQL supports, and enumerating them would be a per-version list this
  code cannot verify
  ([introspect.ts:46-52](../../src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/introspect.ts)).
- **A `date` field with a custom format defeats the SQL plugin's new engine** on OpenSearch 2.7.0
  (measured). A `SELECT` is then answered by the legacy engine, without column types, aliases or computed
  expressions, and with a warning saying so; anything else raises the engine's refusal with a hint
  ([§5.8](#58-a-custom-format-date-field-the-legacy-engine-fallback)).
- **The whole result body is buffered** before it is parsed
  ([§3.1](#31-http-only--no-driver-and-what-that-costs)).
