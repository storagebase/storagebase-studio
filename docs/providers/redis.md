## 1. Overview

Redis is an in-memory key-value store. It has no tables, no rows, no SQL, and no relational
schema. LibreDB Studio is a SQL-oriented IDE, so the central design problem is:

> **How do you present a key-value store through the same `DatabaseProvider` interface that
> PostgreSQL, MySQL, and the rest implement — without emulating SQL and without leaking
> Redis-specific concepts into the shared UI?**

The answer is **mapping by convention, not emulation**. The provider does not pretend Redis is
relational. Instead it maps Redis concepts onto the slots the interface already exposes, and
relabels the UI through the provider-metadata hooks (`getCapabilities()` / `getLabels()`) so the
generic components render Redis-appropriate wording.

### Concept mapping

| `DatabaseProvider` slot | Redis realisation | Redis primitive used |
|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| "Table" (the relation kind) | A **key prefix** (e.g. `user:*`) | `SCAN` + prefix grouping |
| "Row" | A **key** | — |
| `query(sql)` | A Redis command (plain text or JSON) | generic `client.call()` |
| `getHealth()` / `getOverview()` | Server stats | `INFO` |
| `getSlowQueries()` | Slow command log | `SLOWLOG GET` |
| `getActiveSessions()` | Connected clients | `CLIENT LIST` |
| `getStorageStats()` | Memory usage | `INFO memory` |
| `runMaintenance('analyze')` | Server info snapshot | `INFO` |
| Indexes / table stats | Not applicable | returns `[]` |

### Valkey, DragonflyDB, KeyDB and Garnet

This provider is what a Valkey connection uses: there is no `valkey` type id, and choosing Redis in
the connection dialog is the documented way to reach it. `ioredis` speaks the protocol all five
servers share, and the connection dialog's wire-compatibility hint names the engines this driver has
been measured against, from the same data
([`compatibility.ts`](../../src/lib/db/compatibility.ts)). The full per-engine table is in
[`README.md`](./README.md#wire-compatible-engines); three behaviours belong here because they are
this provider's code, not the engine's.

**The overview names the server when `INFO` names itself.** `getOverview()` calls
`labelServerVersion()` ([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts), in
`getOverview()`), the same self-naming-wins rule the MySQL provider's own `labelServerVersion()`
applies to `VERSION()` ([mysql.md §1.1](./mysql.md#11-mariadb-and-the-other-mysql-protocol-engines)):
when the reply names a vendor, show that name; `redis_version` alone is the fallback for when it
does not. Three of the four relatives publish a version field of their own beside
`redis_version` — Valkey 9.1.1 publishes `valkey_version:9.1.1` and `server_name:valkey`,
DragonflyDB df-v1.40.1 publishes `dragonfly_version:df-v1.40.1`, and Garnet 2.1.5 publishes
`garnet_version:2.1.5` and `server_name:garnet` — and the overview shows each labeled ahead of the
compat level, e.g. **"Garnet 2.1.5 (Redis 7.4.3)"**. KeyDB 6.3.4 publishes no version field of its
own at all, so `redis_version` there already is the real version and the overview shows it bare,
same as a stock Redis 6.

**`maxclients` is not universal.** `maxConnections` reads `parsed.maxclients`, falling back to
`parsed.max_clients` (Dragonfly's underscored name for the same limit — `max_clients:64000`
measured live), and `0` when neither is present. Redis, Valkey and KeyDB each publish
`maxclients:10000`; Dragonfly publishes the limit under the underscored name instead. Garnet's
`INFO` carries no client-limit field under either name at all, so its panel reads 0 — an absent
limit shown as a zero, not a measured one. **Garnet extends that to two more numbers**: it publishes no
`used_memory`, so `getOverview().databaseSize` and the memory storage panel read `0 B` for a
populated server, and neither `keyspace_hits` nor `keyspace_misses`, so the cache hit ratio reads
the `: 100` fallback and the dashboard rates it *Excellent* (recorded as D14 in
[`../BACKLOG.md`](../BACKLOG.md)). Its `connected_clients` also stays 0 with a client attached,
though `CLIENT LIST` itself answers correctly - the session list is right while the count above it
is not.

**Every `CLIENT LIST` field is optional, and the absent ones surface as defaults.**
`getActiveSessions()` ([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts)) splits each
line into `key=value` pairs and substitutes a default for anything missing: the session's user is
`user` falling back to `default`, its pid `id` falling back to `0`, its state `flags` falling back
to `N`, its command `cmd` falling back to `idle`. A relative that omits a field therefore produces a
plausible-looking row rather than an error.

Three relatives diverge, all measured on the versions above:

- **Dragonfly publishes no `user=` field at all**, so the user column reads `default` regardless of
  which ACL user the connection authenticated as — the fallback is always the answer there, not the
  exception. Its line also carries no `cmd=` and no `flags=` at all, so the query column reads
  `idle` and the state column `N` for every session, whatever that session is doing.
- **KeyDB reports a command without its subcommand** (`cmd=client` where Redis and Valkey both send
  `cmd=client|list`), which the query column shows verbatim.
- **Garnet answers `CLIENT LIST` in full** - the session row is complete and correct - so the
  divergence there is not in this reply but in the counters above it, listed under `maxclients`.

Valkey is otherwise the closest of the four: every surface in this document answered against
Valkey 9.1.1, with the version panel the single caveat. Garnet answers every surface too, and its
key browser grouped 71 keys into `user:*`, `session:*` and `queue:*` exactly as Redis does — what
separates it is the three numbers above, not a missing surface. It also keeps nothing on disk: a
restart empties it (measured, `dbsize` 71 before and 0 after), so a fixture there has to be
re-seeded rather than restarted into.

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Where it sits

The database layer uses the **Strategy Pattern**. Every provider implements the
[`DatabaseProvider`](../../src/lib/db/types.ts) interface, and most of the shared mechanics live
in the abstract [`BaseDatabaseProvider`](../../src/lib/db/base-provider.ts). Providers are grouped
by family on disk:

```
src/lib/db/
├── base-provider.ts          # abstract base: state, helpers, default metadata, getMonitoringData()
├── types.ts                  # DatabaseProvider interface + all DTOs
├── errors.ts                 # DatabaseError hierarchy + mapDatabaseError()
├── factory.ts                # createDatabaseProvider() — dynamic import per type + provider cache
└── providers/
    ├── sql/                  # postgres, mysql, sqlite, oracle, mssql (extend SQLBaseProvider)
    ├── document/             # mongodb
    └── keyvalue/
        └── redis.ts          # ← RedisProvider (this document)
```

### 2.2 Class hierarchy

```
DatabaseProvider (interface, types.ts)
        ▲
        │ implements
BaseDatabaseProvider (abstract, base-provider.ts)
        ▲
        │ extends
RedisProvider (redis.ts)
```

`RedisProvider` extends `BaseDatabaseProvider` directly (unlike the SQL providers, which extend an
intermediate `SQLBaseProvider`). It overrides every abstract method plus the three metadata hooks
(`getCapabilities`, `getLabels`, `prepareQuery`). It inherits `getMonitoringData()` from
[`base-provider.ts`](../../src/lib/db/base-provider.ts), which fans the individual monitoring methods
out in parallel.

### 2.3 What the base class gives you for free

`RedisProvider` reuses these inherited members rather than reimplementing them:

- **State machine** — `setConnected()`, `setError()`, `isConnected()`, `ensureConnected()`.
- **Instrumentation** — `trackQuery()` (active-query counter) and `measureExecution()` (wall-clock timing).
- **Helpers** — `formatDuration()`, `getSafeConfig()` (password-stripped logging), `logError()`.
- **Default `getMonitoringData()`** — orchestrates `getOverview` + `getPerformanceMetrics` +
  `getSlowQueries` + `getActiveSessions` (+ optional tables/indexes/storage) concurrently.

### 2.4 Registration & lifecycle

The factory wires Redis in via a dynamic import so the `ioredis` driver is only loaded when a Redis
connection is actually opened by `createDatabaseProvider()`
([`factory.ts`](../../src/lib/db/factory.ts)):

```ts
case 'redis': {
  const { RedisProvider } = await import('./providers/keyvalue/redis');
  return new RedisProvider(connection, options);
}
```

API routes use `getOrCreateProvider()`, which caches the connected provider per `connection.id` and
evicts it after 30 minutes idle. `disconnect()` is called on eviction and on graceful shutdown
(`SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`).

---

## 3. Design decisions

These are the non-obvious choices. Read this section before changing the provider.

### 3.1 `SCAN`, never `KEYS *`

Schema discovery uses cursor-based `SCAN` with `COUNT 100`, **not** `KEYS *` in
the object surface ([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts)). `KEYS *` is O(N) and blocks the
entire Redis server until it completes — catastrophic on a production instance with millions of
keys. `SCAN` is incremental and non-blocking. The scan is also capped at `maxScan = 1000` keys so
schema introspection stays bounded regardless of keyspace size.

### 3.2 Key-prefix grouping as "tables"

`keyGrouping()` ([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts)) takes everything
before the first `:` and appends `:*` — so `user:123` and `user:456` both collapse into the
`user:*` "table". It is module-level rather than a method because the object surface
([§6.1](#61-the-object-surface-789)) groups the same keyspace through it, and two surfaces that
grouped it differently would be two different answers about one server. Keys without a colon are their own group. For each prefix the provider probes
keys with `TYPE` until it has observed up to **3 distinct** value-types — it may inspect more than
3 keys when they share a type — to populate the synthetic column metadata. The resulting
object list is sorted by descending key count so the busiest prefixes surface first.

### 3.3 Generic command dispatch via `call()`

Rather than hand-coding a method per Redis command, `runCommand()`
([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts)) funnels everything through `ioredis`'s
low-level `client.call(command, ...args)`.
This means **any** Redis command works without code changes — `GET`, `LPUSH`, `XADD`, `JSON.GET`,
module commands, etc. The trade-off is that there is no per-command validation; an unknown or
mis-arity command surfaces as a Redis-side error wrapped in `QueryError`.

### 3.4 Two query formats, one parser

`executeRedisCommand()` ([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts)) dispatches the
query string by its first character:

- Starts with `{` → parsed as a **JSON command object** `{ "command": "GET", "args": ["k"] }`.
- Anything else → parsed as a **plain command** with a small quote-aware tokenizer that preserves
  single/double-quoted arguments (so `SET k "hello world"` is two args, not three).

The dispatch happens *after* leading blank lines and `#` comment lines are dropped, so the character
that decides the format is the first character of the first runnable line, not of the buffer.

### 3.4a Comments and how one command is picked out of a buffer

`commandBody()` reduces the buffer to the one command to run, in two steps:

1. **Every `#` comment line is dropped**, wherever it sits — leading, interleaved or trailing. A
   line is a comment only when it *starts* with `#` (after trimming) **and no quoted argument is
   open across it**, so a `#` inside a key or a value is never mistaken for one — including the
   continuation line of a multi-line quoted value (`SET note "line1` / `#tag"`). The same quote
   state suspends the blank-line rule: a blank line inside an open quoted argument is data.

   Quote state is tracked **only while the block is a plain command**. The block's kind is fixed by
   its first content line with the same test §3.4 uses to pick a parser (`{` first), because the
   tracker's rules are the plain tokenizer's — no escape handling — and a JSON body's `\"` inside a
   string is not a quote to it. A key named `say"hi` therefore left a phantom quote open, no later
   comment line was dropped, and the whole-buffer run reached `JSON.parse` with comments in it:
   *"Invalid JSON command format"* instead of a `TYPE` result. A JSON body needs no tracking anyway
   — a JSON string carries no literal newline, so no line inside one can begin with `#` (#427).
2. **The first blank-line-delimited block of what remains is taken**, and its lines are joined back
   with a **newline**, verbatim. Leading blank lines are padding and are skipped; the first blank
   line *after* content ends the block.

A block rather than a line, because *outside quotes* the tokenizer treats a newline as ordinary
whitespace: a single command wrapped over several lines (`HSET k a 1` / `b 2`) has always run whole,
and `JSON.stringify(cmd, null, 2)` is legitimately multi-line — taking only line 1 would silently
half-execute both. Not the whole buffer, because the generated cheatsheet (§5.3) is a list of
alternatives separated by blank lines, and running it must run only its first command.

Joined with a newline and not a space, because the tokenizer's whitespace branch is guarded by
`!inQuote`: *inside* a quoted argument a newline is data. `SET note "line1` / `line2"` stores a
two-line value, and a space join silently rewrote it to `line1 line2`. Lines are also appended
without trimming, so indentation inside a quoted value survives.

The dispatch of §3.4 then looks at the first character of that block, not of the buffer. A JSON
command is parsed whole, so a trailing **comment** after a JSON body is fine (it was dropped in
step 1) but trailing **non-comment** text is not — it joins the block and fails `JSON.parse`.

Input that is only comments or blank lines raises
`QueryError("No command to run (only comments or blank lines)")`.

This mirrors the embedded LibreDB provider, and exists so the commented cheatsheet the schema
explorer inserts is directly runnable: selecting one command runs it, and running the whole buffer
runs its first one (#427).

Since S8 the **execution confirmation gate reads a buffer the same way**:
`src/lib/db/destructive-commands.ts` drops `#` lines and takes the first block as above, dispatches
on a leading `{` as §3.4 does, and asks before running any command in its Redis destructive
vocabulary - key, expiry, string, hash, list, set, sorted-set and stream writes, the scripting
entry points, and the server and access commands, with container commands such as `CONFIG SET`
matched on their two-token spelling - while a body it cannot read (broken JSON, a JSON body whose
`command` is not a string) asks rather than staying silent.

### 3.5 Reply normalisation into the shared grid

Redis replies are heterogeneous (status strings, integers, nil, flat arrays, hash arrays, bulk
`INFO` text). `formatResult()` ([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts))
normalises each into the standard `{ rows, fields, rowCount }` envelope so the existing
`ResultsGrid` renders them unchanged. See the [reply table](#52-result-shaping) below.

### 3.6 No connection pool

Redis is single-threaded and a single multiplexed connection is the idiomatic client model, so the
provider holds **one** `ioredis` client and ignores the `PoolConfig`. `connect()` uses
`lazyConnect: true` and then calls `connect()` explicitly so connection failures surface
deterministically at `connect()` time rather than on first command.

---

## 4. Connection

### 4.1 Configuration fields

Redis uses the discrete-field form of `DatabaseConnection` (not `connectionString`):

| Field | Required | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `host` | ✅ standalone | Validated in `validate()` — throws `DatabaseConfigError` if missing. Not read in Sentinel mode ([§4.4](#44-sentinel)) |
| `port` | — | Defaults to `6379`. Not read in Sentinel mode |
| `user` | — | The **Redis 6 ACL user**, sent as ioredis's `username`; empty means `default` ([§4.1a](#41a-acl-users-d29)) |
| `password` | — | Sent as `password`; omit for unauthenticated instances |
| `database` | — | Logical DB index, parsed as int; defaults to `0` |
| `ssl` | — | `SSLConfig`; becomes the ioredis `tls` option ([§4.3](#43-ssl--tls)) |
| `sentinels` | ✅ Sentinel | Comma-separated `host[:port]` sentinel list; a node without a port takes `26379` ([§4.4](#44-sentinel)) |
| `sentinelMasterName` | ✅ Sentinel | The master group the sentinels monitor, sent as ioredis's `name` |
| `sentinelPassword` | — | Sentinel `AUTH`; empty falls back to `password`. Secret-classified, sealed at rest |

```ts
const connection = {
  id: 'redis-1',
  name: 'Cache',
  type: 'redis',
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 6379,
  user: 'analytics',    // optional — the ACL user; omit to authenticate as `default`
  password: 'secret',   // optional
  database: '0',         // logical DB index
  createdAt: new Date(),
};
```

### 4.1a ACL users (D29)

The modal's **Username** field is the Redis 6 ACL user. `connect()` passes it as ioredis's
`username` (the field is `user` on the connection, `username` in `RedisOptions`), and passes
**nothing at all** when it is empty — a plain `requirepass` server has no ACL user to name, and
ioredis only authenticates as `default` when `username` is absent. A pasted
`redis://analytics:pw@host:6379/0` fills the same field: `parseGenericURL`
([`src/lib/connection-string-parser.ts`](../../src/lib/connection-string-parser.ts)) decomposes the
userinfo into `user` / `password` ([§4.2](#42-connection-string-nuance)).

**A connection saved before the field was writable keeps authenticating as `default`, and there is
nothing to migrate.** `connectionFields` in [`src/lib/db-ui-config.ts`](../../src/lib/db-ui-config.ts)
decides what a save WRITES, and it omitted `user` for `redis` until the settlement round of
2026-08-27 — so the ACL user a person typed was discarded between the box and the driver, and the
value simply was never captured. No migration can restore a credential that was never stored: an
existing connection authenticates as `default` until someone opens it and types a user name, which
now persists. What the same change also stopped is an EDIT losing one: `user` is form-owned rather
than preserved (`FIELD_OWNERSHIP` in [`src/hooks/use-connection-form.ts`](../../src/hooks/use-connection-form.ts)),
so a connection that had a `user` from a pasted URL had it loaded into the box, shown, and then
dropped on save. It is written now.

Measured 2026-08-26 against `redis:latest`, with `default` left `on nopass ~* &* +@all` and a second
user defined `on >probepw ~* +@all -info`, both arms:

```text
{host, port, password}            -> ACL WHOAMI = default | INFO succeeds
{host, port, username, password}  -> ACL WHOAMI = probe   | INFO refused: NOPERM
```

The first arm is the defect this replaced: the configured principal was dropped silently, the
session ran as `default`, and health went green under someone else's permissions. Both arms together
are what make it a measurement — the value was collected by the form and stored on the connection
already; only `connect()` ignored it.

**A restricted user costs the INFO-derived surfaces.** ioredis's own ready check calls `INFO`, and on
`NOPERM` it logs *"Skipping the ready check"* and connects anyway — which is the wanted behaviour: a
least-privilege user must still be able to connect and browse keys. But `getHealth()`,
`getOverview()` and `getPerformanceMetrics()` all read `INFO` ([§7](#7-monitoring--health)), so for a
user without `+info` they raise the server's own `NOPERM` sentence rather than answering with
fabricated zeros. `POST /api/db/test-connection` reports that as a **degraded** (amber) result, not a
green tick and not a failure: the connection is real, the health read is not. Grant `+info`,
or expect the monitoring panels to stay empty for that user.

### 4.2 Connection-string nuance ⚠️

`getCapabilities().supportsConnectionString` is **`false`** — the provider itself only consumes
discrete fields. However, the UI connection-string parser
([`src/lib/connection-string-parser.ts`](../../src/lib/connection-string-parser.ts)) *does*
recognise `redis://` and `rediss://` URLs and **decomposes** them into `host` / `port` (default
`6379`) / `user` / `password` / `database` before they reach the provider. So a user can paste a
`redis://:pw@host:6379/0` URL into the modal, but the provider never sees the raw string. A userinfo
name becomes the ACL user ([§4.1a](#41a-acl-users-d29)).

Because the raw string is dropped, the scheme's TLS intent has to travel as a field: the parser
returns `sslMode: 'require'` for `rediss://` and `sslMode: 'disable'` for `redis://`, which the
connection form applies to the SSL panel ([§4.3](#43-ssl--tls)). Both arms are explicit on purpose -
a paste overwrites the form rather than merging into it, so pasting a plaintext URL clears a
`require` left over from a previous edit.

### 4.3 SSL / TLS

`buildTLSOptions()` ([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts)) maps
`connection.ssl` onto the single `tls` option ioredis hands to `tls.connect`, so the material travels
under Node's own names — the same mapping the PostgreSQL, MySQL and Couchbase adapters use:

| `ssl.mode` | `tls` option |
|------------|--------------|
| absent / `disable` | **not present at all** — ioredis negotiates TLS whenever `tls` is set, `{}` included |
| `require` | `{ rejectUnauthorized: false }` |
| `verify-system` | `{ rejectUnauthorized: true }`, with no `ca` — the runtime's own trust store |
| `verify-ca` / `verify-full` | `{ rejectUnauthorized: true }` |

`caCert` / `clientCert` / `clientKey` become `ca` / `cert` / `key` when set, each independently — a
server can demand mutual TLS while presenting a self-signed certificate itself. An explicit
`ssl.rejectUnauthorized` always wins over the mode. `require` does not check the chain because a
self-hosted Redis presents a self-signed certificate by default; every other mode does check it, and
`verify-system` (D26) checks it against the trust store the runtime already has, so a managed Redis
whose certificate a public root signs needs no PEM pasted at all. ioredis exposes no separate
host-name check, so `verify-ca` and `verify-full` build the same object.

Measured against a TLS-only server on 2026-08-23 (`redis:latest --port 0 --tls-port 6380`, so no
plaintext port exists): `disable` is refused with *"Connection is closed."* and `require` connects in
1ms. Both arms matter — before the mode reached the driver, `require` failed the same way `disable`
does, so the pair is what distinguishes a wired path from a documented shape.

> A pasted `rediss://` URL arrives with `mode: 'require'` and a `redis://` one with `disable`
> ([§4.2](#42-connection-string-nuance)), so the scheme picks the mode and the panel is only needed

>
> Measured through the parser and the provider together on 2026-08-23, against
> `redis:latest --port 0 --tls-port 6390` with a self-signed certificate:

> ```text

> redis://localhost:6390  -> sslMode disable | FAILED: Failed to connect to Redis: Connection is closed.
> ```

### 4.4 Sentinel

A connection that sets `sentinels` or `sentinelMasterName` is in **Sentinel mode**. `host` and
`port` are not read at all: `redisOptions()` hands ioredis the sentinel list and the group name,
and ioredis asks the sentinels for the current master on every connect and reconnect. That is what
makes a failover transparent: when Sentinel promotes a replica it kills the old master's normal
clients (`CLIENT KILL TYPE normal` is part of its reconfiguration), ioredis reconnects through the
sentinels, and it lands on the new master. `role` stays ioredis's default, `master`. The
connection form offers **Standalone** (the default and the old behaviour, unchanged) or
**Sentinel**. In Sentinel mode host and port give way to *Sentinel Nodes* and *Master Name*.

```ts
const connection = {
  id: 'redis-ha',
  name: 'Cache (HA)',
  type: 'redis',
  sentinels: 'redis-node-0.redis-headless:26379, redis-node-1.redis-headless:26379',
  sentinelMasterName: 'mymaster',
  password: 'secret',     // Redis AUTH; the sentinels use it too unless sentinelPassword is set
  database: '0',
  createdAt: new Date(),
};
// -> new Redis({ sentinels: [{host, port: 26379}, ...], name: 'mymaster', password,
//                sentinelPassword: password, db: 0, sentinelRetryStrategy, ... })
```

- **Parsing.** `parseSentinelNodes()` splits on commas, drops blanks, reads `[::1]:26380` as an
  IPv6 host, and gives a node without a port `26379`. A port that is not a TCP port (`host:abc`,
  `host:`, `host:70000`) and an unbracketed IPv6 address are refused with a `DatabaseConfigError`
  naming the entry, not defaulted.
- **`validate()`** refuses Sentinel mode with no sentinel node, with no master name, or with an SSH
  tunnel enabled. The factory forwards `host:port` through a tunnel, and a Sentinel connection has
  neither, so the alternative would be a connection quietly going around the bastion.
- **Sentinel password defaults to the Redis password.** The ordinary chart deployment (Bitnami's
  `sentinel.enabled`) protects Redis and Sentinel with one secret, so an empty `sentinelPassword`
  sends `password`. A sentinel that requires no password is still reached: ioredis catches the
  server's *"AUTH ... called without any password configured"* reply, logs a warning and carries on
  (`event_handler.js` in ioredis 5.11.1). Set `sentinelPassword` only when the two differ. There is
  no separate sentinel ACL user (`sentinelUsername`). The connection's `user` is the Redis ACL user
  only.
- **Bounded sentinel retries.** ioredis retries an unreachable sentinel list forever by default,
  and `connect()` would then never settle, so the connection test would hang with nothing on screen.
  `sentinelRetryStrategy` retries the whole list three times (200, 400 and 600 ms apart) and then
  gives up with ioredis's own *"All sentinels are unreachable and retry is disabled. Last error:
  ..."*. A master that is unreachable after the sentinels answered is a different case. ioredis's
  ordinary `retryStrategy` handles it and keeps retrying, which is the failover window.
- **A client that gave up is reported.** When the bounded retries run out during a *reconnect*,
  ioredis ends the client for good. `connect()` listens for `end` and marks the provider
  disconnected, so the provider cache opens a fresh client on the next request instead of serving
  a dead one.
- **TLS covers both hops.** With the SSL panel on, the same `tls` object goes to the sentinels as
  `sentinelTLS` and to the master with `enableTLSForSentinelMode: true`. Without that flag ioredis
  speaks plaintext to the master it resolved, whatever `tls` says.
- **Per-database reads resolve too.** The object surface opens a short-lived client per numbered
  database ([§6.1](#61-the-object-surface-789)). It goes through the same `redisOptions()`, so each
  one asks the sentinels for the master as well. That costs one extra round trip per read.
- **Identity.** `connectionFingerprint` (the object-edit plan seal) and the agent's
  `connectionIdentity` frame `sentinels` and `sentinelMasterName` in Sentinel mode, because they,
  not `host`/`port`, decide which server answers. They are appended only when set, so no digest
  recorded for a standalone connection moves.

## 5. Query interface

### 5.1 Accepted formats

```text
# Plain command (quote-aware)
HGETALL user:1
SET greeting "hello world"
KEYS user:*

# JSON command object
{ "command": "HGETALL", "args": ["user:1"] }
{ "command": "SET", "args": ["greeting", "hello world"] }

# Comments: blank lines and lines starting with '#' are skipped (see 3.4a)
# Read every field of the hash
HGETALL user:1
```

### 5.2 Result shaping

`formatResult()` maps each Redis reply type onto grid columns:

| Redis reply | `fields` | Example cell |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Simple string / status (`GET`, `PING`, `SET`) | `result` | `OK`, `PONG`, `hello-world` |
| Integer (`DEL`, `DBSIZE`, `INCR`) | `result` | `(integer) 42` |
| `nil` | `result` | `(nil)` (rowCount `0`) |
| Empty array | `result` | `(empty list)` (rowCount `0`) |
| Array (`KEYS`, `SMEMBERS`, `LRANGE`) | `index`, `value` | `1 \| user:1` |
| Hash (`HGETALL`) | `field`, `value` | `email \| a@b.com` |
| `INFO` | `section`, `key`, `value` | `Server \| redis_version \| 7.2.4` |

`INFO` is special-cased: `parseInfoResult()` ([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts))
splits the bulk reply into one row per metric, tagging each with its `# Section` header.

### 5.2a A `MULTI` a statement left open (D75)

A bare `MULTI` sent through `query()` opens a transaction on the ONE connection this provider holds
(§3.6), and the provider is cached per `connection.id` for the whole process, so nothing in the
request cycle closes it and it belongs to whoever borrows the handle next.
Measured 2026-09-15 on redis 7.4.11 through ioredis 5.11.1: after a bare `MULTI`, every later
command on that connection answers the string `QUEUED` and does nothing, `SET`, `GET` and even
`CLIENT INFO` alike, while a second connection is untouched.
So the next user's command does not fail, it silently does not happen, and the schema explorer's
`SCAN` is queued with it.

`endOpenQueryTransaction()` ends it and reports `"none"` or `"rolled-back"`.

**WHICH CALLERS END IT, AND WHY THAT CHANGED.** The surface now has TWO callers in the product,
`POST /api/db/multi-query` and `POST /api/db/query`, each awaiting it in a `finally` under a call
scope of its own. **The editor never sends a Redis buffer to the first of those.**
`use-query-execution.ts` gates the multi-statement route on `dialectIsSql`, read from
`queryLanguage`, and this provider declares `json` (§9), so an editor run goes to
`POST /api/db/query` (§12.2).

When this section was first written that was the end of the story, because the single-statement
route ended nothing: it could not, since the ender named one shared client rather than the caller's
own session, and copying the other route's `finally` there was measured to destroy other callers'
committed work. D87 closed that by binding the ender to a call scope the route mints, and D74 then
gave this route the `finally` it had been refused. So a `MULTI` typed into the editor IS discarded
when the response is sent, and the schema explorer's next `SCAN` is no longer queued behind it.

**The ask and the act are TWO commands, and the order is what makes the method safe to call.** The
substitution is the reading: inside a `MULTI` the server answers the status `QUEUED` instead of the
command's own reply, so `PING` answers `PONG` when nothing is open and `QUEUED` when something is,
and `endOpenQueryTransaction()` sends `DISCARD` only after it has seen `QUEUED`. ioredis itself
publishes no transaction state for a `MULTI` sent through `call()`: `status` stays `ready`, and the
queueing that `Redis.prototype.multi()` tracks lives on a pipeline object a raw command never
touches. The server is the only thing that can be asked, and this is how it is asked.

Asking first is not a refinement. Measured on redis 7.4.11 with an ordinary read-only ACL,
`ACL SETUSER ro on >pw ~* +@read +ping +info`: `PING` answers `PONG` and `DISCARD` is refused with
`NOPERM User ro has no permissions to run the 'discard' command`. Since the caller awaits this in a
`finally`, a blind `DISCARD` made every multi-query request on such a connection answer an error and
threw away the per-statement results it had already earned; with the ask first, no `DISCARD` is sent
and the answer is `"none"`. That same ACL cannot run `MULTI` either, so there is never one to end.

The narrower ACL that CAN open a `MULTI` but not discard it, `+@read +ping +multi +set`, measured
on the same server, still raises, and must: `PING` answers `QUEUED`, the `DISCARD` is refused, the
next command is still `QUEUED`, so the transaction is open and this provider cannot end it. The one
`DISCARD` failure that is read rather than raised is the server's own `ERR DISCARD without MULTI`
AFTER the reading said `QUEUED`, which on this shared connection means another caller ended it in
between; the queue is gone either way, which is what `"rolled-back"` reports.

`DISCARD` and not `EXEC`: a script that queued commands and never said `EXEC` did not ask for them
to run, so the queue is dropped rather than executed on an authority nobody gave.

**WHAT IS STILL OPEN: the ender cannot tell whose `MULTI` it is ending.**
`endOpenQueryTransaction()` takes the caller's call scope on the interface and ignores it here,
because this provider holds one connection and there is no other client to name.
That is true and it is not the same as the transaction being the caller's own: a `MULTI` is state
of the CONNECTION, and one connection serves every concurrent request on this stored connection.
So `POST /api/db/query`, which now ends what it opened in a `finally` (above), PINGs and on `QUEUED`
`DISCARD`s whatever `MULTI` is open there, whoever opened it.
A plain `GET` typed by one user drops a `MULTI` another user had just queued commands into, and that
user is told nothing: their next command answers `QUEUED` from no transaction.
The one `DISCARD` failure this code reads rather than raises is the same collision seen from the
other side.
This is the D87 shape on a single connection and it is NOT closed.
Closing it means the `MULTI` owned by a call scope rather than by the connection, which is a design
change: the provider would have to record which scope opened the `MULTI` it observes, and a `MULTI`
opened before any scope was recorded still has no owner.
The same argument applies to `sqlite` and `duckdb`, which likewise hold one handle for every
concurrent request and ignore the scope for the same reason.

### 5.3 Schema-explorer menu actions

Right-clicking a node in the schema tree (or its `⋮` menu) offers commands generated for that node,
so you do not have to type them from memory. The generation is driven by the `queryDialect: 'redis'`
capability, which routes the shared client-side query generators
([`src/lib/query-generators.ts`](../../src/lib/query-generators.ts)) to Redis command output.

Before #427 Redis declared no dialect, so those generators fell through to their MongoDB branch on
the strength of `queryLanguage: 'json'` alone and every action emitted a
`{"collection": "user:*", "operation": "find", …}` document that this provider answered with
`Command is required in JSON format`. The dialect is checked **before** `queryLanguage` everywhere
for that reason.

Both generators are **type-aware**: they read the sampled Redis type off the synthetic `type`
column that the object surface builds (§6). A prefix that sampled a single type resolves; one that
sampled several (`string, hash`) or none does not, and falls into the unknown bucket.

**Scan Keys** (`generateTableQuery`) inserts one runnable command and executes it immediately:

| Node | Sampled type | Command |
|------|--------------|---------|
| prefix group `user:*` | any | `SCAN 0 MATCH user:* COUNT 50` |
| bare key `counter` | `string` | `GET counter` |
| bare key `session` | `hash` | `HGETALL session` |
| bare key `queue` | `list` | `LRANGE queue 0 -1` |
| bare key `tags` | `set` | `SMEMBERS tags` |
| bare key `board` | `zset` | `ZRANGE board 0 -1 WITHSCORES` |
| bare key | unknown or mixed | `TYPE <key>` |

A prefix group always SCANs and is never used as a key argument: it is a derived grouping
(`tablesAreDerivedGroupings`), so `GET user:*` would read a key literally named `user:*`. `TYPE` is
the unknown-bucket answer rather than a guessed reader, because a wrong reader (`GET` on a hash)
returns a `WRONGTYPE` error instead of an answer.

**Generate Command** (`generateSelectQuery`) inserts a cheatsheet instead — a use-case comment above
each command, where **every command line is runnable on its own** via "Run Selected". For a
`user:*` group whose keys sampled as `hash`:

```text
# Redis commands for "user:*" — select a line and Run Selected.

# List keys under this prefix — ONE scan iteration, not the whole set.
# 0 is the start cursor; the reply's first row is the next cursor. Re-run
# with that value in place of 0 until it comes back 0 (a page may be empty).
SCAN 0 MATCH user:* COUNT 50

# Check the key's type
TYPE user:1

# Read every field of the hash
HGETALL user:1

# Create or update one field — this overwrites an existing field
HSET user:1 field example

# Time to live in seconds (-1 no expiry, -2 no such key)
TTL user:1

# Delete the key (DEL takes a literal key name, never a pattern)
DEL user:1
```

Shape rules:

- The `SCAN` block appears only for a prefix group. A bare key starts at `TYPE`.
- The example key for a prefix group is the prefix plus `1` (`user:` → `user:1`), so every line is
  concrete rather than a `<placeholder>` — the same rule the LibreDB cheatsheet follows.
- The read/write pair appears only when the type resolved. An unknown or mixed group gets the
  `TYPE` / `TTL` / `DEL` frame alone. The pairs are `GET`/`SET`, `HGETALL`/`HSET`,
  `LRANGE`/`RPUSH`, `SMEMBERS`/`SADD`, `ZRANGE`/`ZADD`.
- `DEL` is given a literal key, never the group pattern: Redis key arguments are byte strings, so
  `DEL user:*` deletes a key named `user:*` or nothing at all.
- Glob metacharacters are escaped in the `MATCH` half of a `SCAN` only (a key `a[b:1` groups to
  `a[b:*`, whose unescaped `[` would open a character class), never in a key argument, where
  escaping would corrupt a literal key that genuinely contains `*`.
- An argument containing whitespace is double-quoted for the tokenizer of §3.4. An argument that the
  tokenizer cannot round-trip — one containing `"`, `'`, a backslash or a newline — makes **that line
  alone** switch to the lossless JSON command form (`{"command":"DEL","args":["say\"hi\""]}`). The two
  forms mix freely inside one cheatsheet: the provider decides per run, and every line is run on its
  own. Plain `DEL "say"hi""` would reach the driver as the key `sayhi` — a different key.
- The node name in the **header comment** is JSON-quoted, not interpolated raw. A key name is
  arbitrary bytes: a name containing a newline used to end the comment and make its own remainder
  the buffer's first runnable line, so a key called `a⏎DEL user:1 x` produced a cheatsheet whose
  first command was `DEL user:1`. The per-argument defence above never engaged, because the
  injection travelled through a comment rather than through a command. The LibreDB cheatsheet header
  is quoted the same way. For an ordinary name the rendering is unchanged (#427).
- **`SCAN 0 MATCH <prefix>* COUNT 50` is ONE cursor iteration, not a listing.** `0` is the start
  cursor and the reply's first row is the next cursor; re-run with that value in place of `0` until
  it comes back `0`. On a large keyspace an iteration can legitimately return a **non-zero cursor and
  no keys**, so "Scan Keys" may show a cursor and nothing else while the schema tree reports the
  prefix has keys — the tree's count comes from the object surface, which loops the cursor over up to
  1000 keys (§6) rather than stopping at one page. A one-line command cannot loop, so the cheatsheet
  documents the continuation instead of hiding it.

A Redis tab is typed `redis` and rendered by a dedicated Monaco language
([`src/lib/editor/redis-language.ts`](../../src/lib/editor/redis-language.ts)) — command verbs as
keywords, argument words such as `MATCH` / `COUNT` / `WITHSCORES` as functions, `#` line comments.
Before #427 a Redis tab was typed `mongodb` and highlighted as JSON, which flagged every command as
a syntax error.

Four menu actions are **not offered** on Redis, all for the same reason: they address the row as an
object, and a `user:*` row is this server's grouping of a key prefix, not an object any command can
be given.

- `Profile Table` and `Generate Test Data` profile an object and insert rows into it. Both are
  hidden wherever `tablesAreDerivedGroupings` is true rather than left to answer HTTP 400 (#427).
- **Redis offers no per-row maintenance action at all** — neither *"Key Info"* nor *"Memory
  Doctor"*. Both items call `onOpenMaintenance("tables", <row>)`, which opens the admin Operations
  tab against a named table; there is no such table here, so the item was a dead end even for the
  `analyze` this provider does declare (#427). Global maintenance is unaffected and still runs from
  the Operations page (§8).

`Generate Code` stays — it names the row, it does not address it, and it sanitises the name into an
identifier that is legal in every target language (`user:*` → `User`), keeping Unicode letters
intact so a non-ASCII key prefix does not collide with another one.

---

## 6. Schema introspection

the object surface ([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts)) returns one
object per key prefix:

```
1. cursor = "0"
2. loop:
     [cursor, keys] = SCAN cursor COUNT 100
     for each key:
        prefix = substring before first ':' + ':*'   (or the whole key)
        increment prefix.count
        if prefix has < 3 DISTINCT sampled types: TYPE key → add to prefix.types
           (one blocking round-trip per key until the 3rd distinct type — a
            uniform prefix pays it for every key the scan cap allows)
   until cursor == "0"  OR  totalScanned >= 1000
3. emit one object per prefix, sorted by rowCount desc
```

Each synthetic object has three columns: `key` (string, primary), `value` (typed by the
sampled Redis types, e.g. `string/hash`), and `type`. `indexes` is always empty (`getIndexStats()`
and `getTableStats()` return `[]` — Redis has no indexes or table statistics).

### 6.1 The object surface (#789)

the object surface above answers one flat key-prefix list. The object surface answers a lazy,
container-aware, kind-tagged tree through four methods, and on this engine they live in the provider
class, because there is no statement layer to split out: the catalog here is a command.

Everything below was measured on **Redis 8.10.0** against the fixture in
[`docker/redis-init/`](../../docker/redis-init/) (see [§11.5](#115-the-object-surface-fixture)),
plus the four Redis-wire relatives named in [§1](#valkey-dragonflydb-keydb-and-garnet).

#### The declaration

**One container level, and there is no second one to add above or below it.** A Redis server holds a
fixed number of NUMBERED databases and nothing else: there is no catalog above them, and a key is not
a container. The level's structural `id` is `schema`, which is what `ContainerLevelSpec` calls the
innermost level on every engine; the label is the engine's own word, which is Database.

How many there are is **not the constant 16**. `listContainers()` asks the server, because the answer
is a property of the deployment:

```
$ redis-cli CONFIG GET databases                 # stock server
databases
16
$ redis-cli CONFIG GET databases                 # same image, --cluster-enabled yes
databases
1
$ redis-cli SELECT 3                             # on that cluster-mode server
ERR SELECT is not allowed in cluster mode
```

So the reply already reflects the deployment and nothing reads `cluster_enabled` to work it out. A
refused or unparsable reply **raises**: 16 would be a number nobody measured, and 1 would hide
fifteen databases that may hold keys. Every database is listed, including the empty ones, because a
Redis database is never created and never dropped — all of them exist at all times, so listing only
the ones `INFO keyspace` mentions would hide a database a person is about to write to.

| Kind | Role | Catalog |
|---|---|---|
| `keyspace` | `relation` | one bounded `SCAN` walk of the database, collapsed per key prefix |
| `function` | `routine` | `FUNCTION LIST` |

`function` is a real, named, stored object: a Redis 7.0 function library is persisted, replicated,
listed by `FUNCTION LIST` and addressed by its `library_name`. It declares `hasSource` and it is the
only thing in this engine that can — `FUNCTION LIST WITHCODE` answers the library's Lua source
verbatim, shebang line included, which is Phase 2's to render.

**Three candidates are absent rather than declared and zero.**

- An **`EVAL` script** is not enumerable. Redis publishes `SCRIPT EXISTS <sha>`, which answers about
  a sha the caller already has, and there is no `SCRIPT LIST`. A tree node is something that can be
  listed, so a kind here would draw a folder that could never fill.
- A **keyspace notification** is pub/sub, not a stored trigger: nothing is persisted and nothing has
  a name.
- The separately named **"Triggers and Functions"** feature is RedisGears-based, ships only in Redis
  Stack and Enterprise, and is on Redis's own deprecated list. Declaring it would draw a folder on
  every plain server that has no such concept at all.

#### The declaration is static, and one measurement is what decides that it has to be

Three of the four Redis-wire relatives refuse `FUNCTION LIST` outright, each in its own words (all
measured 2026-09-11):

| Server | `INFO` version | `FUNCTION LIST` |
|---|---|---|
| Redis 8.10.0 | `redis_version:8.10.0` | Supported |
| Valkey 9.1.1 | `valkey_version:9.1.1`, `redis_version:7.2.4` | Supported |
| KeyDB 6.3.4 | `redis_version:6.3.4` | ``ERR unknown command `FUNCTION`, with args beginning with: `LIST`, `` |
| DragonflyDB df-v1.40.1 | `redis_version:7.4.0` | `ERR Unknown subcommand or wrong number of arguments for 'LIST'. Try FUNCTION HELP.` |
| Garnet 2.1.5 | `garnet_version:2.1.5`, `redis_version:7.4.3` | `ERR unknown command` |

A version-driven declaration, the shape `mysql.ts` uses, would be **wrong** here rather than merely
awkward: DragonflyDB reports `redis_version:7.4.0` and still has no `FUNCTION LIST`, so the version
cannot answer the question. `countObjects()` therefore carries the server's own sentence under
`{ unavailable }`, which is the state `KindCount` has for a refused read, and the folder says why it
has no number instead of showing a zero nobody measured. Per KIND and not per read: a relative with
no `FUNCTION` command still has a keyspace, so its function folder carries the refusal while the
keyspace folder carries a real number. Measured live against KeyDB 6.3.4 holding this fixture:

```
countObjects(["0"]) -> {"keyspace":{"count":4},
                        "function":{"unavailable":"ERR unknown command `FUNCTION`, with args beginning with: `LIST`, "}}
```

#### Where the count and the listing meet

Standing ruling 5f says the badge and the folder must read the same predicate over the same source.
On a SQL engine that is a warning about two `WHERE` clauses. Here the catalog is a command, so the
seam is a **method**: `listIn` is the only thing in the provider that reads either catalog, and both
`countObjects()` and `listObjects()` call it. The count of a kind is the LENGTH of the listing that kind's
own enumerator returned — there is no second `SCAN` with a different `MATCH` for the two to drift
apart in.

#### The `keyspace` count is a FLOOR when the walk stopped on its key budget

`KindCount` carries four facts, and this engine answers two of them in one record. `function` is
counted from `FUNCTION LIST`, which enumerates the whole server, so it is a population. `keyspace` is
counted from the bounded `SCAN` walk: the loop stops when the cursor comes back to `0`, which means
the server walked everything it holds, **or** when 1000 keys have been seen, which means it did not.
Only the second case is marked, with the fourth state:

```
countObjects(["0"]) -> {"keyspace":{"count":3,"sampledFrom":"the first 1,000 keys of one SCAN walk"},
                        "function":{"count":1}}
```

The tree badges that folder **`3+`** and titles it *"At least 3: counted from the first 1,000 keys of
one SCAN walk"*, while the exact count beside it stays `1` with no title
([`flatten.ts`](../../src/components/object-tree/flatten.ts)). A completed walk is NOT marked: `2` and
`2+` are different claims, and marking a number this provider measured exactly would teach a reader
to discount every badge. The same bound already governs the object surface, so the flat list and the tree
are consistent about which walk they read; what is new is that the tree can now say what the number
is.

#### The derived-grouping refusal, and the declaration that carries it

`tablesAreDerivedGroupings: true` ([§9](#9-capabilities--labels)) is a refusal about the `keyspace`
rows: `user:*` is a prefix this server derived from a bounded scan, not an object anybody named, and
no command can be given that row. The flat row menu read that flag directly. The object model's menu
is driven by the KIND, so the refusal needed somewhere to live, and it splits into three:

- **Row writes.** `keyspace` declares no `acceptsRowWrites`, so Generate Test Data and the insert
  action are withheld by the kind, with no engine-wide flag involved.
- **Maintenance.** Redis declares its one maintenance operation as `perEntity: false`
  ([§8](#8-maintenance)), so `maintenanceControl` withholds the per-row links by the same declaration
  that already governed them.
- **Profile** has no kind-level declaration behind it, and it is the one that needed a decision.
  Profiling needs an ADDRESSABLE object to compute per-column statistics over, while every other
  relation action here needs only a pattern. So `rowActions` reads the same engine-wide
  `tablesAreDerivedGroupings` flag the flat menu read, and
  [`row-actions.ts`](../../src/components/object-tree/row-actions.ts) says so at the top of the file.

**Generate Query is NOT withheld, and that is deliberate rather than an oversight.** The generator
answers `SCAN 0 MATCH user:* COUNT 50` for a prefix group, a runnable command against exactly the
keys the row summarises ([§5.3](#53-schema-explorer-menu-actions)), and the row click that opens data
runs the same thing. The flat menu did not withhold it either.

#### Object identity, and what `describeObject()` answers

A `keyspace` object's last path segment is the PATTERN (`user:*`), which is unique within its
database because it is a map key of the scan walk. A `function` object's last segment is the
`library_name`, which Redis enforces as unique per server: a second `FUNCTION LOAD` of the same name
is refused unless `REPLACE` is given, and `FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME <name>` addresses exactly one.

**A function library is SERVER-scoped while its folder is PER DATABASE, so the same library is listed
under every database.** On a stock server answering `CONFIG GET databases` with 16, one
`libredb_probe` appears in all sixteen Function Libraries folders, at sixteen different paths, and
`countObjects` for a database holding no keys at all still answers a `function` count of 1. Measured
on Redis 8.10.1: `FUNCTION LIST` takes no database argument and answers identically after `SELECT 0`
and after `SELECT 7`, where `DBSIZE` is 0. This is deliberate. The engine declares one container
level, the numbered database, so there is no server level to hang the folder on, and showing the
libraries under one chosen database would invent a home the engine does not have while making the
other fifteen lie about what the server holds.

A key grouping describes to the same three columns the object surface emits, from one shared helper, so
the flat model and the object model cannot describe the same grouping differently while both surfaces
are live. A grouping the CURRENT scan no longer holds raises rather than answering an empty shape: on
this engine a prefix disappears the moment its last key is deleted.

A function library answers three empty arrays with **no round trip**. That is a true fact about the
kind rather than a failed read — a library has no columns, no indexes and no foreign keys.

**The two kinds are therefore asymmetric about EXISTENCE, on purpose.** `describeObject()` answers a
valid detail for ANY `function` name, a library that was never loaded included, because nothing there
reads the catalog; a `keyspace` whose grouping the current scan no longer holds raises. Existence is
not the same question on the two kinds: a key grouping is derived from a scan and ceases to exist the
moment its last key is deleted, so an empty shape would claim a grouping that is gone, while a
library's detail at this depth is a property of the KIND rather than of the object and is correct
without asking. Paying a `FUNCTION LIST` round trip only to raise would buy a check Phase 1 never
shows a person. Phase 2's Source tab is where the two must agree, and it needs care: measured on Redis
8.10.1, `FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME no_such_library` answers an **empty array rather than an error**,
so the reader has to treat emptiness as absence itself, and the miss then belongs in
`describeObject()` rather than in the tab.

#### What `describeObjects()` answers, and the two bounds it reports

`describeObjects(container, kind, limit?)` is the bulk column read (#789): the columns of
every object of one kind in one database, from ONE walk.

**One walk for a whole folder.** Nothing here sends a statement, so the N+1 the inventory
route removed does not come back as round trips: `describeObject()` runs a full
`scanKeyGroups` walk of its own, and a body looping it would walk the keyspace once per
grouping. The suite counts the driver's `SCAN` calls - one for the folder, against two for
two single reads - because that is the only observable difference between the two, and a
timing comparison over the loopback would pass either way. Measured live on redis:latest at
port 16379 with the committed fixture, 2 ms for one `describeObjects(["0"], "keyspace")`
against 6 ms for the four `describeObject()` calls it replaces.

**A function library folder answers `{ details: [] }` and sends nothing at all** - not even
the `FUNCTION LIST` the listing needs. A library has no columns, no indexes and no foreign
keys, and its source, the one thing it does have, is Phase 2's through
`FUNCTION LIST WITHCODE`. That is a true statement about the KIND rather than a refused
read, which is why it is an empty batch and not a throw. A kind this provider declares and
has no command for is a different fact and RAISES, with the same sentence `listObjects()`
refuses with: "this kind has no columns" and "this file has no reader for this kind" must
not arrive as the same empty answer.

**One mapper, shared with the single read.** `keyspaceDetail()` builds both, over
`keyGroupColumns()`, which is also what the object surface builds its rows from. Every column set
the bulk read answers is byte-identical to `describeObject()` for the same path, checked for
every grouping in the fixture and re-checked live.

**Two bounds, and the answer names whichever bit.**

| Bound | Applies to | `truncated.limit` | `truncated.reason` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The caller's `limit` | `keyspace` | the caller's own number | `the bulk column read was bounded at N objects by its caller` |
| The 1,000-key walk | `keyspace` | the number of objects answered | `the key walk stopped at the first 1,000 keys of one SCAN walk` |
| Both | `keyspace` | the caller's own number | the two joined with `, and ` |

The second is a bound this provider did not choose on the call, so it is reported on an
unbounded read as readily as on a bounded one: a cap nobody can see is the defect
`truncated` exists to prevent, and it is the same fact `countObjects()` already puts on the
badge through `KindCount.sampledFrom`. It cannot bite on the `function` folder, which sends
nothing, so the marking is per KIND here exactly as it is in the count. Measured live
against a database holding 1,200 keys under one prefix: an unbounded read answers one
column set and reports `the key walk stopped at the first 1,000 keys of one SCAN walk`.

A limit that is not a positive whole number **raises** rather than being clamped, and the
guard runs after the declaration check and after the container check.

**The cut is ours, because this engine offers nothing to cut under.** Every other engine in
#789 pushes a `LIMIT` down and re-sorts in code, so a bounded read's MEMBERSHIP is the
server's and its ORDER is ours. There is no such split here. `SCAN` publishes no order at
all, not even a stable one between two walks of an unchanged keyspace, and its bound is on
KEYS rather than on groupings, so there is no `limit + 1` to push down: a walk cannot know
how many groupings it will produce until it has finished. Both the membership and the order
of a bounded read are `comparePaths`', and this document says so rather than implying an
order the server does not have.

The UTF-8-byte versus UTF-16-code-unit divergence Task 26a-2 measured on five SQL engines
has nothing to bite on here for the same reason: there is no server-side sort to disagree
with.

#### Object source (#789)

`readObjectSource(path, kind, limit?)` answers ONE kind and the **declaration** says which. `function`
declares `hasSource` and `sourceLanguage: "lua"`; `keyspace` declares neither, because a key prefix is
a grouping this server derived from a bounded `SCAN` and nobody wrote a definition for it. That is the
`tablesAreDerivedGroupings` refusal carried into the object model rather than left behind with the
flag's old reader. The refusal is read off the declaration and never off the kind id, so a kind this
engine does not declare at all takes the same path and raises with the same sentence.

The command is `FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME <name> WITHCODE`, sent once. It is server-scoped and takes
no database: measured, one `FUNCTION LOAD` is visible from every numbered database and `SELECT` does
not change what it answers.

**The path SHAPE is checked here, by the same function and the same sentence `describeObject` uses.**
`assertObjectPathShape` derives the accepted length and the labels in its message from
`declaredLevels`, so a path is refused with `A Redis "function" path is [database, name], received []`
rather than reaching the command. Both methods need it because neither is reached only through the
HTTP route: they are published through `@libredb/studio` and called by the embedded host seam and by
the conformance helper, and none of those sees the route's own bound. Measured before the check
existed: an empty path made the name `undefined` and ioredis threw
`undefined is not an object (evaluating 'arg.toUpperCase')` out of its command encoder, which is this
provider's defect arriving as the driver's.

**A kind declaring `hasSource` and no `sourceLanguage` RAISES** with
`Redis declares readable source for the kind "function" and no sourceLanguage to render it with`,
before the round trip. There is no fallback to a literal `lua`: an unregistered or absent Monaco id
degrades to plain text with no throw and nothing observable, so a fallback would hide a deleted
declaration behind a Source tab that had quietly stopped highlighting. The isolated census
(`tests/isolated/object-source-declarations.test.ts`) pins every declared language, so the only way to
reach this arm is a declaration somebody removed.

| Field | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | `definition` | one part, always: a library has one Lua text |
| `label` | `Definition` | rendered as-is |
| `language` | the kind's declared `sourceLanguage`, which is `lua` | `lua` IS a Monaco language id the installed 0.56.0 bundle registers, unlike `plsql`, `tsql` and `cql` |
| `form` | `complete` | the text runs as given: it is what `FUNCTION LOAD` was handed |
| `origin` | `stored` | the author's own bytes. Measured on Redis 8.10.0: `WITHCODE` answers the shebang line and the body exactly as they were loaded, with no reformatting |

**The selection is BYTE-EQUAL, and that is the whole of the parser's reason to exist.** Measured on
Redis 8.10.0 against the committed fixture:

```
$ redis-cli FUNCTION LIST                              # the dictionary is CASE-SENSITIVE
library_name
libredb_probe
library_name
LIBREDB_PROBE
$ redis-cli FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME libredb_probe    # the argument is a CASE-INSENSITIVE glob
library_name
libredb_probe
library_name
LIBREDB_PROBE
```

One lookup for either name answers BOTH, so a reader taking `reply[0]` would hand back the other
library's Lua as this object's definition. The entry whose `library_name` is byte-equal to the last
path segment is the one read, and its `library_code` is found by walking the key/value pairs rather
than by position, the same rule the listing's parser records: the nested `functions` value is itself a
list of key/value lists, and RESP3 answers a map where there is no order at all.

**An absent library RAISES.** Measured on Redis 8.10.0,
`FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME no_such_library WITHCODE` answers an **empty array** and not an error, so
emptiness is absence here and a provider that returned a document would invent one. An entry that
matches by name and carries no `library_code`, or an empty one, takes the same arm: an empty text
would put an empty editor over a definition that was never read.

**A refused read is the server's own sentence, unprefixed**, carried as the part's `unavailable` and
never as a text. Measured as the ACL user the fixture creates:

```
$ redis-cli --user libredb_nofunction --pass nofunction FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME libredb_probe WITHCODE
NOPERM User libredb_nofunction has no permissions to run the 'function|list' command
```

KeyDB, DragonflyDB and Garnet have no `FUNCTION` command at all and each refuses in its own words (the
table in [§6.1](#61-the-object-surface-789) has them), so this path is reachable on three of the four
Redis-wire relatives this type id serves.

**Only the server's own error reply is a refusal. A transport failure RAISES.**
Measured against ioredis 5.11.1 and Redis 8.10.0: an ACL denial and an unknown command both reject with
a `redis-errors` `ReplyError`, whose `name` is `ReplyError`, while a dropped socket rejects with a plain
`Error` named `Error`, reading `Connection is closed.` with the offline queue on and
`Stream isn't writeable and enableOfflineQueue options is false` with it off.
A read that catches both would show `Connection is closed.` in the Source pane as this object's own
refusal, with no raise, no retry affordance and nothing in the document telling it apart from a real
`NOPERM`, so the provider raises a `ConnectionError` naming the library instead.

**A caller's bound** cuts one part's text and reports itself through the one sentence every engine
uses, `the source read was bounded at <n> characters by its caller`. An exact answer is never marked.
The bound counts UTF-16 code units, so a bound landing between the two halves of a surrogate pair drops
the pair rather than emitting a lone surrogate; the mark still names the number the caller asked for.

#### Object edit (#789)

`buildObjectEdit(request)` and `applyObjectEdit(plan)` write an edited definition back. Every claim in
this section was measured on Redis 8.10.0 in a container created for it, holding
[the committed fixture](#115-the-object-surface-fixture) applied the way §11.5 says.

**ONE kind is editable and the declaration says which.** `function` declares
`acceptsSourceEdits: true`; `keyspace` declares nothing, which is the same refusal it already makes
for `hasSource` and for the same reason: a key prefix is a grouping this server derived from a
bounded `SCAN`, nobody wrote a definition for it, so there is nothing to edit and no folder that
could offer one. Every readable `function` part therefore carries `edit: { offered: true }` and a
`keyspace` part carries no `edit` field at all, which is a different fact from an `offered: false`.

**The editable unit is the LIBRARY and never one registered function.** Redis publishes no surface
that writes one function of a library, and the Phase 2 declaration already says so: the kind's
objects are libraries and `FUNCTION LIST WITHCODE` answers a library's whole Lua source.

**The strategy is `replace-in-place-command`, and the previewable unit is a COMMAND.** It is the only
day-one producer of that arm of `ObjectEditUnit`, and the arm exists because of it:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `medium` | `command` |
| `name` | `FUNCTION` |
| `arguments` | `["LOAD", "REPLACE"]` |
| `payload` | the reader's own bytes, one `user` segment covering all of them |

Rendering that as pseudo-SQL would be a lie about what runs. There is no splice anywhere: the payload
is the submitted text verbatim, so the coordinate arithmetic between the sent text and the reader's
text is the identity.

**Ruling 1b, both axes, measured.** A FAILURE cannot lose the object: four refusal shapes were
measured and after every one of them `FCALL libredb_ping 0` still answered `pong`.

| Submitted | The server's answer |
|---|---|
| a syntax error | `ERR Error compiling function: user_function:5: '=' expected near 'local'` |
| a body registering nothing | `ERR No functions registered` |
| no shebang | `ERR Missing library metadata` |
| `#!moon` | `ERR Engine 'moon' not found` |

A SUCCESS can destroy something, which is the second axis: `REPLACE` replaces the WHOLE LIBRARY. A
body carrying only `libredb_ping` loaded successfully, answered `"libredb_probe"`, and
`FCALL libredb_echo_key` then answered `ERR Function not found`. The sibling was deleted and success
was reported.

**THE SHEBANG IS THE IDENTITY, and the build refuses an edited one.** `FUNCTION LOAD` takes no name
argument: the name comes out of the `#!lua name=<library>` line and the command's reply IS that name.
Three measured consequences follow from one line of text, and only the third is harmless:

- A CONSISTENT rename of the library and its functions SUCCEEDS, answers the NEW name, creates a
  SECOND library and leaves the original answering. Without the refusal the reader sees a success,
  the pane re-reads the original address and shows the original text, and their edit has vanished.
- A shebang naming a DIFFERENT library that ALREADY EXISTS replaces THAT library, wholesale. Measured
  by doing it: a body whose shebang said `name=LIBREDB_PROBE`, submitted while addressed at
  `libredb_probe`, replaced `LIBREDB_PROBE` (`FCALL LIBREDB_UPPER_PING` then answered the new body's
  value) and left `libredb_probe` answering `pong`. So this check also protects an object the reader
  was never shown. The two libraries differ only in case, which is the same fixture pair the source
  read's byte-equal selection needs.
- A ONE-CHARACTER typo in the name alone is refused loudly by the engine,
  `ERR Function libredb_ping already exists`, because function names are GLOBAL to the server rather
  than scoped to their library.

A first line this provider cannot parse as a shebang is refused the same way, with `identity`. That
is the safe direction: the cost is a false refusal, and measured, a body with no shebang is refused
by the server too. The ENGINE token is deliberately not checked, because an unknown one is refused
loudly and harmlessly and Redis is free to add a second engine.

**The library is selected BYTE-EQUAL, for the reason the source read gives**: `LIBRARYNAME` is a
case-INSENSITIVE glob over a case-SENSITIVE dictionary, so one lookup answers both fixture libraries
and a build taking `reply[0]` would show one library's Lua and plan a write against the other's name.

**The revision is a content hash, and it is SOUND on this engine and only on this engine.** Measured:
`FUNCTION LIST WITHCODE` answers the bytes AS LOADED, with no reformatting of any kind, so two reads
of an unchanged library are byte-identical and a SHA-256 over them is a usable token. On an engine
that renders a definition from a parse tree, as Trino's `SHOW CREATE FUNCTION` does, the same hash
would move on a server upgrade and refuse every edit. The check is `compared` and not `guarded`:
the apply re-reads and compares in its OWN round trip, which NARROWS the window and does not close
it, because Redis has no transaction spanning the read and the write. `basis` is
`FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME <name> WITHCODE`.

**The collateral warning is a catalog fact and it names EVERY function the library registers.** The
build reads the library's registered functions out of the SAME reply that carried the code,
unconditionally, and any library plans with one consequence:

```
loses:  replaces-whole-container
fact:   { source: "FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME libredb_probe",
          observed: "libredb_echo_key, libredb_ping" }
```

A library registering exactly ONE function is warned about too, and this is a CORRECTION of an
earlier claim in this file that it planned `consequences: []`.
That claim rested on the premise "a library IS its one function, so re-registering it loses
nothing", and the premise is about the SUBMITTED text, which nothing on this path reads: the only
identity check is the shebang library name and no Lua parser is involved anywhere.
MEASURED on a Redis 8.10.0 container on 2026-09-14: `libredb_probe` registering only `libredb_ping`,
loaded again with `FUNCTION LOAD REPLACE` over a body registering `libredb_other` under the same
shebang, answered `libredb_probe`, `FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME libredb_probe` then answered
`libredb_other` alone, and `FCALL libredb_ping 0` answered `ERR Function not found`.
Through this provider that edit built `consequences: []` and applied `applied-with-collateral`
naming `libredb_ping`, so the build promised a loss could not happen while the apply reported one
that had, which is a success destroying something the reader was never shown.
The cost of the correction is one warning and one acknowledgement tick on every single-function
edit, including the ones that re-register the same name.

`consequences: []` survives for one population and it is not a library shape: a `FUNCTION LIST`
reply the provider can read a library out of and no function names out of.
MEASURED on 8.10.0, `FUNCTION LOAD` over a body registering nothing answers
`ERR No functions registered`, so no live library reaches it.
The names are SORTED, because `FUNCTION LIST` answers them in an internal order and a
warning that reworded itself between two identical reads would show a reader a difference that is not
one. No Lua parser is involved anywhere: the fact is what the library registers TODAY, never a
prediction about what the submitted text will register.

**Three build refusals, in this order**: the read bound (`guard`), byte-identical text
(`definition`), then the shebang (`identity`). The read bound has a live population, which is what
`libredb_bulk` is in the fixture for: measured, `FUNCTION LOAD` ACCEPTS a library over the 1,000,000
character source bound and `FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME libredb_bulk WITHCODE` reports a `library_code`
of **1,000,243** characters for the one the fixture loads. Submitting the pane's bounded text back
would delete the 243 characters past the bound and report success.

**The apply sends the PLAN'S OWN unit**, verb, literal arguments and payload, and never rebuilds the
command from constants of its own: the dialog renders `plan.unit` and the apply sends `plan.unit`, so
byte-identity between the preview and the write is structural. Three round trips at most:

1. `FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME <name> WITHCODE`, the re-read, FIRST, so nothing sits between the
   comparison and the write. A library whose bytes moved is `conflict` / `object-changed` carrying the
   server's current text for the diff, and NOTHING is executed. A library that was deleted answers the
   empty string, which is what is there.
2. `FUNCTION LOAD REPLACE <the payload>`.
3. the same re-read again, which supplies the NEW revision token and answers the collateral question.
   `lost` is what disappeared between round trip 1 and round trip 3, a fact read AFTER the write: the
   plan said what WOULD be lost, this says what WAS.

**The reply is checked against the addressed name.** The reply of `FUNCTION LOAD REPLACE` IS the
library name the server read from the shebang, so a reply naming another library is
`applied-elsewhere`, carrying the server's own reply in `wrote` and `undone: false`, because Redis
offers this design nothing to take it back with and it will not issue a `FUNCTION DELETE` of its own.
It is a CONTROL rather than the primary guard: the build's shebang check already refused that text, so
what this catches is a shebang-extraction bug in the provider. Round trip 3 is skipped on that arm,
because the addressed library was not written.
The comparison is BYTE-EQUAL and case-sensitive, for the same reason the library selection is: a reply
differing from the addressed name only in case names a DIFFERENT library on this engine, and measured
on 8.10.0 a load addressed at `libredb_probe` whose shebang said `name=LIBREDB_PROBE` replaced
`LIBREDB_PROBE` wholesale and left `libredb_probe` untouched. A case-folding comparison would report
that write as `applied` against an object the reader was never shown.

**A plan whose revision is not `compared` RAISES**, and it does so before the first round trip. This
provider issues `compared` on every plan it builds, so any other revision arrived from somewhere else,
and reporting "no revision was available" as `conflict` / `object-changed` would assert that the object
moved when nothing observed it moving. A statement unit and an undeclared kind raise for the same
reason and in the same place.

**Refusal classes, from the server's own first word, which on Redis is the error code:**

| Reply | Class | `at` |
|---|---|---|
| `READONLY You can't write against a read only replica.` | `privilege` | `none` |
| `NOPERM User libredb_nofunction has no permissions to run the 'function\|load' command` | `privilege` | `none` |
| `ERR Error compiling function: user_function:4: ...` | `definition` | `user`, line 4, column 1 |
| every other `ERR` | `definition` | `none` |

A replica refusal is `privilege` although it is not about permissions, because the refusal class is a
statement about what the reader does next and "use a different connection" is the same answer. The
compile error's line number needs no correction: measured with two points, a `@@@` on physical line 2
answered `user_function:2` and the same error on physical line 4 answered `user_function:4`, so the
count is 1-based, includes the shebang and is already the reader's own line. It is still converted
through core's coordinate map rather than returned as a number, so a line the reader's text does not
have answers `outside` instead of a coordinate Monaco would silently clamp.

**A transport failure is `interrupted`, never a refusal**, with `committed: "unknown"`. The
distinction is `isServerErrorReply`'s, the same one the source read makes, and it carries the same
measurement: nobody answering is not the server answering no. `rolled-back` is never claimed here,
because no transaction was opened.

**A read the server REFUSES raises rather than becoming a refusal**, which is the one asymmetry with
`readObjectSource`. A `NOPERM` on `FUNCTION LIST` leaves the build knowing nothing about the object,
so there is no plan to issue and no fact a refusal could carry; the pane's own read has already shown
that sentence.

**No session state is pinned.** `FUNCTION LOAD` is server-scoped: measured, one load is visible from
every numbered database and `SELECT` does not change what `FUNCTION LIST` answers, so nothing this
apply does depends on a session another borrower of the connection can move. `plan.session` is `[]`.

##### The measured acceptance run (#789)

Driven through `POST /api/db/objects/source`, `POST /api/db/objects/edit-plan` and `POST /api/db/objects/edit-apply` against a running Studio, on a container created for the run.
`INFO server` answered `redis_version:8.10.0`.
The fixture was applied by hand, because this image has no init-script directory: `docker exec -i <container> redis-cli --no-raw < docker/redis-init/01-object-fixture.redis`, one connection for the whole file.
`FUNCTION LIST` afterwards answered three libraries, `libredb_probe` registering `libredb_echo_key` and `libredb_ping`, `LIBREDB_PROBE` registering `LIBREDB_UPPER_PING`, and `libredb_bulk` registering `libredb_bulk_ping`.

**THE COLLATERAL RUNS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.**
`libredb_probe` registers two functions, so a body registering only `libredb_echo_key` builds a plan carrying one consequence, `replaces-whole-container`, whose fact is `{ source: "FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME libredb_probe", observed: "libredb_echo_key, libredb_ping" }`.
Applying it answers `applied-with-collateral` whose `lost` entry names `libredb_ping` alone, which is the function that actually went, and `FUNCTION LIST` afterwards shows `libredb_probe` registering `libredb_echo_key` only.
`LIBREDB_PROBE` registers one, so an edit that keeps that one built `consequences: []` and the apply answered plain `applied` ON THE RUN RECORDED HERE.
That build answer is no longer what this provider gives: a single-function library now carries the same warning, for the measured reason recorded above, and the apply's answer for that edit is unchanged.
The acknowledgement is enforced by the SERVER and not by the dialog: the identical collateral apply with an empty `acknowledged` answers HTTP 400, `this apply destroys something the plan warned about and the request did not acknowledge: replaces-whole-container`, and the library is untouched.

**A FAILED APPLY LEAVES THE LIBRARY BYTE IDENTICAL.**
This engine has no transaction that can roll a failed apply back, so the assertion is that `FUNCTION LIST WITHCODE` is byte identical across the apply and that the library-to-function map is unchanged.
Five failures were driven against `libredb_probe` and all five left both readings identical.

| What was sent | Where it was refused, and what it answered |
| --- | --- |
| A Lua compile error | the engine: `refused`, `definition`, `ERR Error compiling function: user_function:6: unexpected symbol near '='`, at line 6 of the reader's own text |
| A body registering nothing | the engine: `refused`, `definition`, `ERR No functions registered` |
| A shebang naming `LIBREDB_PROBE`, which EXISTS | the build: `built: false`, `identity`, before anything is sent |
| No shebang at all | the build: `built: false`, `identity` |
| A second writer replaced the library between the build and the apply | the apply's re-read: `conflict`, `object-changed`, carrying the server's CURRENT text |

The third row is the one the shebang check exists for.
`FUNCTION LOAD` takes no name argument, so the shebang IS the address: sending that body would have replaced `LIBREDB_PROBE` wholesale and left `libredb_probe` untouched, and the reader would have destroyed an object they were not looking at.

**A TRUNCATED PART CANNOT BE EDITED, and this engine HAS the population.**
`libredb_bulk` reads as `truncated: { limit: 1000000, ... }` with NO `edit` key and 1,000,000 characters of text, and an edit of it inside the route's bound is refused by the build with the `guard` class naming the server's own 1,000,243 characters.
The CONTROL, `libredb_probe` at 252 characters, carries no `truncated`, carries `edit: { offered: true }`, and builds.

**THE AUDIT.**
One successful apply added exactly two `object_edit` events under one `correlationId`: an `action: "PLAN"` decision event and an `action: "replace-in-place-command"` outcome event, both `result: "success"`.
A sentinel planted in the submitted Lua appears in neither event and nowhere in the process's stdout.

#### Reads go to the CONTAINER's database, never the session's

Every object read opens its own short-lived connection with `db` set, rather than issuing `SELECT` on
the shared client: a `SELECT` there would decide which database a concurrent query in the same session
ran against. Nothing in the object surface ever sends `SELECT`.

## 7. Monitoring & health

All monitoring derives from Redis introspection commands. `parseRedisInfo()` turns the `INFO` bulk
string into a flat `key → value` map that the methods below read from.

| Method | Source command | Returns |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| `getHealth()` | `INFO` | `connected_clients`, `used_memory_human`, hit ratio |
| `getOverview()` | `INFO` + `DBSIZE` | version, uptime, clients, maxclients, memory, key count (`tableCount`) |
| `getPerformanceMetrics()` | `INFO` | cache hit ratio, `instantaneous_ops_per_sec` → `queriesPerSecond` |
| `getSlowQueries()` | `SLOWLOG GET 10` | per-entry id, command text, duration (µs → ms) |
| `getActiveSessions()` | `CLIENT LIST` | one session per client (id, addr, db, flags, cmd, idle) |
| `getStorageStats()` | `INFO memory` | `used_memory_human`, optional `usagePercent` vs `maxmemory` |
| `getTableStats()` | — | `[]` (N/A) |
| `getIndexStats()` | — | `[]` (N/A) |

**Cache hit ratio** is computed by `calculateHitRatio()`
([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts)) as
`keyspace_hits / (keyspace_hits + keyspace_misses) * 100`, defaulting to `100.0` when there has
been no traffic.

The monitoring methods that depend on optional Redis features (`SLOWLOG`, `CLIENT LIST`) are wrapped
in try/catch and degrade to `[]` rather than throwing — a restricted ACL that forbids those commands
won't break the monitoring dashboard.

---

## 8. Maintenance

Redis exposes a single maintenance operation:

| Type | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `analyze` | Runs `INFO` and reports the number of lines in the output as a snapshot. Non-destructive. |
| anything else | Throws `QueryError` (`Unsupported maintenance type for Redis`) |

This is reflected in `getCapabilities().maintenanceOperations = ['analyze']`. The admin Operations
tab has gated each card on that list since #282, so it renders the analyze card only and never
offered Redis a vacuum action; #427 changed the **wording** on that card, not the gate (§9). The
schema explorer's **per-row** menu offers neither *"Key Info"* nor *"Memory Doctor"*, because a
per-row action needs an addressable row and these rows are derived groupings (§5.3).

The admin Operations tab also renders this provider's own wording for the analyze card — *"Run
Info"* / *"Server Info"* / *"Get Redis server information and statistics."* — instead of Postgres's
query-planner copy. Those `analyzeGlobal*` fields had been declared and set for a long time and read
by no component (#427).

### Where each operation may be offered (`maintenanceOperationSpecs`)

Declaring that an operation EXISTS is not enough to put a button on it: two engines that
declare the same `MaintenanceType` take different kinds of target, so each provider also
declares what its own operations may be pointed at. The monitoring Tables tab renders a
per-row control only where `perEntity` is true, the admin Operations tab a whole-database
card only where `global` is true, and both take the wording from `label` (#496).

`POST /api/db/maintenance` reads the same declaration since #U20, and it is the one reader that
REFUSES rather than hides: it takes the placement from whether the request carries a `target`
(absent or empty means whole-database) and answers `400` when this provider marks that
placement unavailable while the other one is available - `{type:"analyze", target:"session:"}`
is that request here, and it is the only one this provider can refuse.

| Operation | Control label | Per-row | Global | Why |
|-----------|---------------|---------|--------|-----|
| `analyze` | Server Info | **no** | yes | `runMaintenance(type)` takes no target parameter at all - the operation is `INFO`, which reports on the server and cannot be pointed at a key prefix |

A per-row control here answered with server-wide metrics for one grouping, which is the
dead end #427 reported for *"Key Info"*. The Operations tab's global card carries Redis's
own *"Run Info" / "Server Info"* wording. *"Memory Doctor"* names no declared operation, so
no control offers it.

## 9. Capabilities & labels

### `getCapabilities()` ([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts))

| Capability | Value |
|------------|-------|
| `queryLanguage` | `json` |
| `queryDialect` | `redis` — routes the client-side query generators to Redis command output and types the editor tab `redis` (see 5.3). Checked before `queryLanguage`, which says only "not SQL" and by itself meant MongoDB (#427) |
| `supportsExplain` | `false` |
| `supportsExternalQueryLimiting` | `false` |
| `supportsCreateTable` | `false` |
| `supportsInlineRowEdit` | `false` — Redis commands are not SQL, so there is no `UPDATE ... SET` for the results grid's inline editor to emit |
| `supportsTransactions` | `false` — `MULTI`/`EXEC` exists in Redis and is not exposed through this provider, so the transaction trio and SANDBOX are not offered (#464). A `MULTI` a script sends anyway is ended by `endOpenQueryTransaction()`, which BOTH query routes now call in a `finally`, `POST /api/db/multi-query` and `POST /api/db/query`, so an editor run ends its own too (D74, D87) ([§5.2a](#52a-a-multi-a-statement-left-open-d75)) |
| `declaresForeignKeys` | `false` — Redis has no constraints at all, and the "tables" here are key prefixes this provider grouped rather than objects anyone declared |
| `tablesAreDerivedGroupings` | `true` — the object surface SCANs a bounded slice of the keyspace and groups the real key names it found by their prefix, so a `user:*` row is this server's own summary and not a key any command can be given. The agent layer states this to a plan run, in one sentence, so a grounded run does not draft a command against a grouping. In the object tree it is what withholds Profile from a `keyspace` row ([§6.1](#61-the-object-surface-789)) |
| `containerLevels` | one level, `schema`, labelled Database ([§6.1](#61-the-object-surface-789)) |
| `objectKinds` | `keyspace` (relation) and `function` (routine, `hasSource`, `sourceLanguage: "lua"`). `function` is the only kind in this engine with a definition text, read through `FUNCTION LIST ... WITHCODE` ([§6.1](#61-the-object-surface-789)). Three further candidates are absent rather than declared and zero |
| `supportsMaintenance` | `true` |
| `maintenanceOperations` | `['analyze']` |
| `supportsConnectionString` | `false` |
| `defaultPort` | `6379` |
| `schemaRefreshPattern` | `(DEL\|FLUSHDB\|FLUSHALL\|RENAME)\b` |

`schemaRefreshPattern` tells the UI which executed commands should trigger a schema (key-pattern)
refresh — i.e. commands that add or remove keys.

### `getLabels()` ([`redis.ts`](../../src/lib/db/providers/keyvalue/redis.ts))

The label map relabels the generic schema-explorer UI for key-value semantics: entity → *"Key
Pattern"*, row → *"key"*, select → *"Scan Keys"*, generate → *"Generate Command"*, analyze → *"Key
Info"*, search placeholder → *"Search keys…"*, etc. `analyzeAction` (*"Key Info"*) is declared but
no longer reaches the schema explorer's per-row menu, which offers no maintenance here at all
(§5.3); it stays because it is the correct wording the moment a per-row target exists.

The labels rename actions that behave differently here, not generic ones wearing Redis names:
*"Scan Keys"* really emits `SCAN`, and *"Generate Command"* really emits Redis commands (§5.3).
That was not true before #427, when both emitted MongoDB documents under these labels.

`statementLanguage` is the one label no person sees: the agent's plan contract states it verbatim to
the model. Unlike MongoDB's, it is not about the language — a plan run on 2026-08-22 wrote real Redis
commands — but about the **shape** they were packaged in:

```
1) KEYS session:*
2) GET session:1
```

`executeRedisCommand` reads the whole body as **one** command (§5), so the server answered
`ERR unknown command '1)'`. The label therefore names the two things that made it unrunnable — the
list numbering and the second command — alongside the two accepted forms (plain and the lossless
`{"command": …, "args": […]}`), and repeats in words what `tablesAreDerivedGroupings` says in a flag:
a `prefix:*` row is this server's grouping, not a key, so a prefix is reached with `SCAN … MATCH`.

`slowQueriesEmptyState` (*"Redis lists what SLOWLOG holds, and nothing has yet run slower than
slowlog-log-slower-than."*) is the monitoring Queries panel's empty state. It exists for the same
reason the `analyzeGlobal*` triad had to be read rather than merely declared (#427): that panel's
sentence was hardcoded to PostgreSQL's `pg_stat_statements` advice on every engine
(#463), while what is empty here is the `SLOWLOG` (§7).

`analyzeGlobalLabel` / `analyzeGlobalTitle` / `analyzeGlobalDesc` (*"Run Info"*, *"Server Info"*,
*"Get Redis server information and statistics."*) are rendered by the admin Operations tab. The
`vacuumAction` / `vacuumGlobal*` fields (*"Memory Doctor"*, *"Memory Analysis"*) are still declared
but reach no screen: the admin Operations tab's vacuum card and per-table button are gated on
`maintenanceOperations` containing `vacuum`, which this provider does not list (§8 — that gate is
#282 and unchanged here), and the schema explorer's row item is hidden because the rows are derived
groupings (§5.3). They stay so the map is complete if a vacuum-shaped operation is ever added.

## 10. Error handling

The provider raises the shared error classes from
[`src/lib/db/errors.ts`](../../src/lib/db/errors.ts):

| Situation | Error |
|-----------|-------|
| Missing `host` at construction | `DatabaseConfigError` |
| Operation before `connect()` | `DatabaseConfigError` (via `ensureConnected()`) |
| `connect()` fails | `ConnectionError` |
| Malformed JSON command | `QueryError` — *"Invalid JSON command format"* |
| JSON without `command` | `QueryError` — *"Command is required…"* |
| Empty command | `QueryError` — *"Empty command"* |
| Redis-side command failure | `QueryError` — *"Redis error: …"* |

All `QueryError`s carry the `QUERY_ERROR` API code and surface to the client as `400 Bad Request`.

---

## 11. Testing

### 11.1 How the tests work

Integration tests live in
[`tests/integration/db/redis-provider.test.ts`](../../tests/integration/db/redis-provider.test.ts).
In keeping with the project's test architecture, the `ioredis` driver is replaced with an in-process
mock via `mock.module('ioredis', …)` **before** the provider is imported — there is no live Redis
container in the suite. The mock simulates a Redis 7.2.x server (`redis_version:7.2.4`,
`INFO`/`SCAN`/`CLIENT LIST`/`call()` responses), which exercises the same code paths as a real
Redis 6.0+ instance.

> ⚠️ **Mock isolation:** `bun`'s `mock.module()` is process-wide. Run the suite with
> `bun run test`, which gives every test file its own bun process, never bare `bun test` across
> multiple files - see the note in [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md). The Redis file mocks `ioredis`,
> which would otherwise leak into any other test sharing the process.

### 11.2 Coverage

The suite covers: validation, connect/disconnect, capabilities, labels, `prepareQuery`, all query
formats (JSON, plain, empty, `HGETALL`, `INFO`, nil), error handling (malformed JSON, missing
`command`, Redis-side error, disconnected provider), schema scanning, health, overview, performance,
slow queries, active sessions, table/index/storage stats, `getMonitoringData`, maintenance, a
battery of common commands (`KEYS`, `SET`, `DEL`, `PING`, `DBSIZE`), the whole object surface
([§6.1](#61-the-object-surface-789)) through `assertObjectSurface` plus per-method assertions, and
**every `ssl.mode` branch**
asserted against the options object the `Redis` constructor received. The same captured options carry
the **ACL user** assertions ([§4.1a](#41a-acl-users-d29)) — `username` present for a named user,
absent for both an empty string and an unset field — and a refused `INFO` is asserted to raise the
server's own `NOPERM` sentence out of `getHealth()`. **Sentinel mode** ([§4.4](#44-sentinel)) is
asserted the same way: the parsed sentinel list, default port and IPv6 form, the master name, the
sentinel-password fallback, the bounded retry strategy, TLS on both hops, the per-database clients,
the `end` listener, and every `validate()` refusal. There is no live Sentinel in the suite.

### 11.3 Run it

```bash
# Just this file
bun test tests/integration/db/redis-provider.test.ts

# Full isolated suite (CI-equivalent)
bun run test
```

### 11.4 Optional: verifying against a live Redis

The committed tests are mock-based by design. To smoke-test against a real server during
development:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
# then point a connection at localhost:6379 in the Studio UI and run e.g. `INFO`, `SCAN 0`
```

To reproduce the ACL rig of [§4.1a](#41a-acl-users-d29) — a user that can browse keys but not read
`INFO`:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name redis-acl -p 6389:6379 redis:latest
docker exec redis-acl redis-cli ACL SETUSER probe on '>probepw' '~*' +@all -info
# Username `probe`, password `probepw`: keys browse, and health reports degraded (amber).
# Leave Username empty and the same password authenticates as `default`, whose INFO succeeds.
```

### 11.5 The object surface fixture

The object surface's fixture is **committed**, not typed into a shell while measuring and then lost
with the container: [`docker/redis-init/01-object-fixture.redis`](../../docker/redis-init/01-object-fixture.redis).

**The `redis` image has no init-script directory.** There is no `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`
convention and no entrypoint hook of any kind — the image runs `redis-server` and nothing else — so
unlike the PostgreSQL and MongoDB services this fixture is not mounted and applied for you. It is a
file of `redis-cli` commands, and the exact command that applies it is:

```bash
docker exec -i libredb-redis redis-cli --no-raw < docker/redis-init/01-object-fixture.redis
```

`redis-cli` reading from stdin uses ONE connection for the whole file, which is what makes the
`SELECT 3` in the middle of it work; a per-line `redis-cli` loop would silently write every key into
database 0. The file is idempotent: it `DEL`s the keys it is about to write and loads the function
libraries with `FUNCTION LOAD REPLACE`.

**The file carries no comments, and that is a constraint rather than a style.** Measured on
Redis 8.10.0: `redis-cli` reading from stdin does NOT skip a `#` line, it sends it as a command, and
the server answers ``ERR unknown command '#'``. Every explanation of what the fixture holds therefore
lives in the table below rather than beside the line.

What it builds, and why each part is there:

| In | What | Why |
|---|---|---|
| db 0 | `user:1` `user:2` `user:3`, `session:abc` `session:def`, `queue:jobs`, `standalone` | three prefixes plus a key with NO colon, which is its own grouping |
| db 0 | mixed value types under one prefix (string, hash, list) | the sampled `type` column is `string/hash`-shaped rather than uniform |
| db 3 | `report:daily` | a key that exists in ONE database and nowhere else, so a provider reading the SESSION's database instead of the CONTAINER's is distinguishable from a correct one |
| db 0 | function library `libredb_probe`, two registered functions | the `function` kind has an object, and `FUNCTION LIST WITHCODE` has source to answer |
| db 0 | a SECOND library `LIBREDB_PROBE`, differing from the first ONLY in case | `LIBRARYNAME` is a case-INSENSITIVE glob over a case-SENSITIVE dictionary, so one lookup answers both and a source read taking `reply[0]` shows the wrong library ([§6.1](#61-the-object-surface-789)); the same pair is what makes the edit path's shebang check testable, since a rename onto the other name would REPLACE it |
| db 0 | a THIRD library `libredb_bulk`, whose `library_code` is 1,000,243 characters | the only object in this fixture OVER the 1,000,000-character source bound, so "a truncated part is never editable" has a population here rather than an argument (#789 Phase 3) |
| server | ACL user `libredb_nofunction`, password `nofunction`, `-function` | a live principal for the source read's refusal pane |

**`libredb_bulk` is one line of about 1,000,270 bytes, and it cannot be generated on the server.**
Measured on Redis 8.10.0: `EVAL` running `FUNCTION LOAD` answers
`ERR This Redis command is not allowed from script`, and so does `FUNCTION LIST`, so there is no
server-side way to build a large library out of a short fixture line. The literal is committed, the
same disposition the equally large Trino fixture blob has. Regenerate it with:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY' >> docker/redis-init/01-object-fixture.redis
pad = "-" * 1_000_100
print('FUNCTION LOAD REPLACE "#!lua name=libredb_bulk\\n'
      "--[[" + pad + "]]\\n"
      "local function bulk_ping(keys, args)\\n  return 'bulk'\\nend\\n"
      "redis.register_function('libredb_bulk_ping', bulk_ping)\"")
PY
```

To measure a cluster-mode container, which is the only deployment where the database count is not 16:

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name libredb-redis-cluster -p 6400:6379 redis:latest redis-server --cluster-enabled yes
docker exec libredb-redis-cluster redis-cli CONFIG GET databases   # -> 1
```

## 12. Usage examples

### 12.1 Programmatic (via the factory)

```ts
import { createDatabaseProvider } from '@/lib/db/factory';

const provider = await createDatabaseProvider({
  id: 'r1', name: 'Cache', type: 'redis',
  host: 'localhost', port: 6379, createdAt: new Date(),
});

await provider.connect();
await provider.query('SET greeting "hello"');     // → OK
await provider.query('GET greeting');             // → hello
await provider.query('{ "command": "HGETALL", "args": ["user:1"] }');
const objects = await provider.listObjects(container, 'table');
const { details } = await provider.describeObjects(container, 'table');
await provider.disconnect();
```

### 12.2 Over the API

`POST /api/db/query` with the Redis command in the `sql` field — see the
[Redis Query Format](../API_DOCS.md#redis-query-format) section of `API_DOCS.md` for the full
request/response contract.

## 13. Known limitations & future work

- **A pasted `rediss://` URL selects `require`, not a verifying mode.** The parser carries the
  scheme as `sslMode` ([§4.2](#42-connection-string-nuance)), so the paste is encrypted, but nothing
  in a `rediss://` URL says whose certificate to trust - and the ordinary self-hosted `--tls-port`
  node presents a self-signed one, which a verifying mode would refuse. Verification therefore stays
  an explicit choice in the SSL panel; the URL alone never turns it on.
- **Redis Cluster is not supported.** A standalone node and a Sentinel-managed master
  ([§4.4](#44-sentinel)) are. A cluster node connects as a standalone one and answers `MOVED`
  for keys it does not own. Sentinel mode has no `sentinelUsername`, cannot run through an SSH
  tunnel, and never reads from replicas (`role: master` only).
- **`SCAN` is capped at 1000 keys** for schema discovery — prefixes that only appear beyond the cap
  won't show as "tables". This is a deliberate bound, not a bug. The object surface shares the same
  walk and the same bound, so on a keyspace larger than it the `keyspace` folder's badge and its rows
  are the groupings of a SAMPLE. They are consistent with each other, because the count is the length
  of that listing ([§6.1](#61-the-object-surface-789)), and neither is a total. The BADGE now says so
  rather than leaving it here: a walk the budget cut short answers `{ count, sampledFrom }` and the
  folder reads `3+`. The flat key-prefix list of §6 has no badge and still says nothing.
- **An `EVAL` script is not an object here**, because Redis publishes no `SCRIPT LIST` — only
  `SCRIPT EXISTS <sha>`, which answers about a sha the caller already has ([§6.1](#61-the-object-surface-789)).
- **No read-only guard.** The generic `call()` dispatch executes write/destructive commands
  (`SET`, `DEL`, `FLUSHALL`, …) the same as reads. Access control is expected to be enforced by the
  Redis ACL / user role, not the provider.
- **Binary values** are stringified via `String(...)`; non-UTF8 binary payloads may not render
  faithfully in the grid.
- **The plain-command tokenizer has no escape syntax.** Quotes group an argument but cannot be
  escaped inside one, so a key or value containing a literal `"` or `'` is not expressible in plain
  form; use the JSON command object for those. The schema-explorer generators detect this and emit
  the JSON form for the affected line automatically (§5.3), so only hand-typed plain commands are
  exposed to it.
- **Non-comment text cannot follow a JSON command.** Comment lines anywhere are dropped, including
  after a JSON body, but the body itself is parsed whole (§3.4a) — so trailing text that is not a
  `#` comment joins the block and fails `JSON.parse`.
- **No column modification in a generated migration.** Since
  [#269](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/issues/269) the schema-diff migration generator
  answers a modified column per dialect; keys are not tables and carry no column definitions, so it
  emits `-- Redis: Cannot alter column "<name>". ...` where it previously emitted PostgreSQL
  `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN` DDL that means nothing here.

## 15. Appendix — checklist for authoring a new provider

This Redis provider is a good template for a non-relational backend. To add another provider:

1. **Create** `src/lib/db/providers/<family>/<name>.ts` extending `BaseDatabaseProvider`.
2. **Implement** the abstract methods (`connect`, `disconnect`, `query`, the five object methods, `getHealth`,
   `runMaintenance`, and the seven monitoring methods). Return `[]` from the ones that don't apply.
3. **Override** `getCapabilities()`, `getLabels()`, and `prepareQuery()` so the shared UI renders
   the right wording and feature flags.
4. **Register** the type in the `factory.ts` switch (dynamic import) and add it to the
   `DatabaseType` union in `src/lib/types.ts`.
5. **Add** the driver dependency to `package.json`.
6. **Map** native driver errors onto the `errors.ts` classes (`ConnectionError`, `QueryError`, …).
7. **Test** with a `mock.module()`-based integration test mirroring the structure above.
8. **Document** the provider in `docs/providers/<name>.md` using this file as the template, and add
   the query format to `docs/API_DOCS.md`.
