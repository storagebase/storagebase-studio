  This module type-imports from `src/lib/db`, which is the opposite of the usual direction,
  and it is deliberate (#789).

  `SchemaSnapshot.schema` stores what the consumer actually held, and that shape is
  `StoredObject`, which is `DetailedObject` with the two fields a record written before the
  object model could not carry. The alternative is a second declaration of the same shape
  here, which is precisely the drift the field's own docblock records: the declaration said
  `TableSchema` while the stored JSON carried two more fields, and a later reader trusted the
  type instead of the data. One declaration, imported, cannot drift.

  It is TYPE-ONLY in both directions and there is no runtime edge: `detailed-object.ts` imports
  `ColumnSchema`, `ForeignKeySchema` and `IndexSchema` from this file, so the two are a type
  cycle that TypeScript resolves and every bundler erases. Nothing is imported for a value, so
  no module graph is created by it.

  // because a connection has to say which product is listening - the SQL endpoint
  // path is product-specific and the wrong one never reaches a SQL engine - and

  // SQL-SHAPED but not SQL: no JOIN, no OFFSET, no EXPLAIN and no subquery are in
  // the grammar at all (each measured on 5.0.9). It is still a `SQLBaseProvider`
  // dialect, because what the editor sends IS the statement text and the shared
  // limiter's `LIMIT n` is correct CQL. The connection's `database` field pins one
  // KEYSPACE, and `localDataCenter` is a field only this engine has - the driver
  // refuses to connect without it.
  | "cassandra"
  // Apache Trino (issue #424 Phase 2). A QUERY ENGINE rather than a store: what the
  // connection's `database` field pins is a Trino CATALOG (`tpch`, `hive`, `iceberg`),
  // the way a PostgreSQL connection pins a database, and the schemas inside it are the
  // schema level. PrestoDB is deliberately NOT this id - the transport builds its
  // header names from a dialect descriptor's prefix, so that fork is a descriptor away
  // rather than a rewrite.
  | "trino"
  // libSQL (issue #424 Phase 5). SQLite's dialect over a network: a self-hosted
  // libSQL server (`sqld`) and Turso Cloud are the SAME id, because they speak the
  // same protocol and embed the same SQLite - the cloud is that server managed, and
  // a connection to either differs only in host and token. It is separate from
  // `sqlite` for the reason the two cannot share a provider: the SQLite one holds a
  // FILE handle through a synchronous driver, and this one holds no handle at all.
  // The credential is a token rather than a password, so the form labels it that
  // way, and the server refuses `VACUUM`, `ANALYZE` and `PRAGMA query_only` - which
  // is why this id offers fewer maintenance operations than `sqlite` does.
  //
  // Turso Database, the Rust rewrite, is NOT this id and has no row anywhere yet: it
  // publishes no server image (`tursodatabase/turso`, `tursodb` and `turso-server`
  // were all unpullable on 2026-08-27) and ships as an in-process npm engine, so
  // there is nothing to connect to and #424 publishes no name it has not connected
  // to.
  | "libsql"
  // DuckDB (issue #424). An EMBEDDED analytical engine: the whole connection is a
  // file path (or `:memory:`), there is nothing listening on a port, and the driver
  // is a native N-API addon this app loads in its own process. It is separate from
  // `sqlite` for the reason those two cannot share a provider even though both open
  // a local file: the dialects disagree (`[1,2][1]` is a list index here, not a
  // quoted identifier; block comments nest; `X'…'` is a STRING rather than a blob),
  // the catalog is DuckDB's own `duckdb_*` table functions rather than
  // `sqlite_master`, and the file admits exactly ONE operating-system process - a
  // second one is refused even in read-only mode, which is why this provider
  // declares `singleWriterFile`.
  //
  // MotherDuck (`md:`), Quack and DuckLake are NOT this id and have no row anywhere
  // yet: each is a different connection story than a local path, and #424 publishes
  // no name it has not connected to.

/**
 * How much TLS a connection asks for.

 * has the knob maps it to `rejectUnauthorized: false`, because a self-hosted server
 * ordinarily presents a self-signed certificate and refusing it would make the ordinary
 * local TLS deployment unreachable.
 *
 * `verify-system` encrypts AND verifies, with nothing to paste: the chain is checked against
 * the trust store the runtime already has (Node's bundled roots plus whatever the host adds)
 * and the certificate must name the host we dialled - `rejectUnauthorized: true` with no
 * `ca`. It is deliberately NOT "verify-ca with the field left blank": `verify-ca` and
 * `verify-full` exist to pin a chain against a `caCert` PEM the user supplies, which is the
 * only way to reach a server whose certificate no public root signs, and a form that asks
 * for a file the user does not have is a connection they cannot complete. `verify-system` is
 * what a managed endpoint (Neon, Supabase, Atlas, RDS, Capella) can satisfy as pasted, which
 * is why it is the mode a boolean `?ssl=true` / `?tls=true` in a connection string maps onto
 * (see `readBooleanTLS` in src/lib/connection-string-parser.ts for the rule).
 *
 * `verify-ca` checks the chain and `verify-full` also the server name. That split is honoured
 * only where the driver exposes the name check on its own - Oracle's `sslServerDNMatch` is
 * the one that does; the Node TLS drivers cannot separate the two, so both land on
 * `rejectUnauthorized: true` there and each provider doc says so.
 *
 * Adding a member here widens a published type (src/exports/types.ts), so every switch and
 * lookup table over SSLMode has to answer for it: the providers listed above, the seed schema
 * (src/lib/seed/types.ts), the PostgreSQL storage backend and the connection form.
