/**
 * The run's context snapshot, and the packing that puts part of it in a prompt
 * (#329 T8, epic #325).
 *
 * A run reasons about a schema it has to be told about, and the two obvious ways to
 * tell it are both wrong: reaching a provider BESIDE the M1 enforcement layer, and
 * serialising the whole inventory into every prompt, which spends the context window
 * on tables the task is not about. This module does neither.
 *
 *  - **Every read goes through the audited pipeline, and there are now TWO of them**
 *    (#414). On a dialect `CATALOG_PLANS` serves, `captureContextSnapshot` calls
 *    `readCatalogForGrounding`, which composes the statement server-side and drives
 *    it through `executeAuditedOperation` under the read-only profile. On every other
 *    dialect it calls `readProviderSchemaForGrounding`, which asks the provider for
 *    its own schema inspection — the reading the sidebar already performs — under the
 *    operations profile.
 *
 *    The second path is not the objection above returning under a new name, and the
 *    difference is mechanical rather than a matter of degree. What "asking the
 *    provider directly" meant was a call with no operation descriptor naming it, no
 *    policy able to deny it, no budget charged for it and no audit line recording it.
 *    This one has all four: `db.schema.read` is a canonical R0 descriptor, the call
 *    is admitted by the run deadline, costs a statement out of `maxStatementsPerRun`,
 *    is denied or allowed by the same policy as every other reach, and lands on the
 *    audit stream under its own operation id — which an operator can deny on its own
 *    without denying any other agent read. So a snapshot still costs the run
 *    something, is still refusable, and there is still no seam for a faster path.
 *
 *    The two paths are a real asymmetry rather than a transitional state, and
 *    PostgreSQL and SQLite deliberately do NOT converge on the provider one. Three
 *    reasons, all of them properties the composed path has and this one cannot:
 *    the composed reads are audited STATEMENT BY STATEMENT rather than as one opaque
 *    call; they carry foreign keys, which the provider path cannot on any engine that
 *    does not declare them; and SQLite's inventory is parsed out of the DDL text the
 *    engine stored, which its provider does not expose in the same shape.
 *  - **The catalog path's rows come back out of the run's artifact store**, keyed by
 *    the correlation id the tool returned — the same store a later claim cites. A
 *    result that has been released or has expired yields no snapshot rather than a
 *    reconstruction from the model-facing text. The provider path does not round-trip
 *    through the store, because it never turned its inventory into text: it returns
 *    the tables themselves and puts a projection of them in the artifact so the call
 *    is still citable. See `readProviderSchemaForGrounding`.
 *  - **The inventory is all-or-nothing.** One refused read loses the whole
 *    snapshot, because an inventory missing its keys while claiming to be whole is
 *    worse than no inventory: the model would reason about relations that are
 *    simply absent from what it was shown. The run then continues WITHOUT a
 *    snapshot and is told to use `inspect_schema` itself, narrowed.
 *
 * The fingerprint is a function of the inventory and nothing else — not of the
 * reading time, not of the connection — so two identical builds agree and a changed
 * schema does not.
 *
 * A captured inventory is also HELD for its connection, in this process, and that is
 * one of the three places a planning run's grounding can come from (#384). It was the
 * ONLY one until 2026-08-15, which is what made plan mode blind after a restart and
 * on a second replica; a plan run now captures its own inventory when neither its
 * ledger nor this hold has one, and fills the hold in turn. The model stays toolless
 * on every one of those paths. See `holdSnapshotForConnection`.
 *
 * That is what makes the REFRESH free. A capture is recorded in the run's ledger
 * with the inventory attached, so a later drive — including one that resumed after
 * the process died — calls `reusableSnapshot` and re-derives its whole schema
 * context from the record it has already read, performing no database operation at
 * all. The fingerprint is the key: the recorded entry is trusted only when the
 * identity it advertises is the one its own inventory produces.
 *
 * SQLite and PostgreSQL answer differently and the asymmetry is structural, not
 * cosmetic: PostgreSQL aggregates its columns into one projection per table and
 * keeps its relation and index projections flat, while SQLite has no structured
 * catalog on this path at all (the guard refuses every `pragma_*` function) and
 * its columns, keys and relations are read out of the DDL text the engine stored —
 * see `sqlite-ddl.ts`.

 * declared kind id. So the map's right-hand side is copied from the provider's own
 * mapping and pinned to it by a source test, the same way `POSTGRES_SYSTEM_SCHEMAS` is:
 *
 *  - PostgreSQL: `postgres.ts`'s `COUNTS_RELATION_ARM` is the CASE its own counts and
 *    listings are taken from, so a relation this path calls a `view` is the one its
 *    object browser draws under Views.
 *  - SQLite: `sqlite_schema.type` carries exactly the four words `sqlite.ts` declares as
 *    ids, so the map is the identity. The composed catalog read selects `table` and
 *    `view` only; the other two are here because the map is the engine's vocabulary and
 *    not this reading's sample of it (ruling 5a).
 *
 * An engine word with no entry - a PostgreSQL foreign table, `relkind = 'f'`, which
 * `information_schema.columns` really does answer for - and an id this CONNECTION does
 * not declare both resolve to NO KIND. The object still reaches the model, named and with
 * its columns, under no word at all: a missing fact filled in with the commonest value is
 * exactly how a view came to be handed over as a table, and a kind the provider never
 * declared is one the tree draws no folder for, so a run and the tree would disagree

 * and refused states are facts it measured. Here there is no per-kind reading at all: one
 * catalog statement answers whatever it answers, and on PostgreSQL that is only the

 * `r`, `p`, `v` and `f`, with a materialized view and a sequence absent from that catalog
 * entirely.
 *
 * So this reports the kinds its own objects were identified as, in the provider's
 * declaration order, with the role and the labels taken from the declaration so a run and
 * the tree say the same words. It reports NO COUNT, because `AgentInventoryKind` carries
 * none and this reading took none, and no `sampledFrom`, because nothing here sampled: the

 * came back at all came back whole. A declared kind that this reading cannot see is simply
 * absent, which is the one thing that must not be mistaken for "the database holds none":
 * `inventoryNotes` and `kindLabel` both speak only about what is in front of them, and
 * `docs/AGENT.md` states the loss.
 *
 * `derivedGroupings` IS carried, and it is carried for the opposite reason `sampledFrom` is
 * not. `sampledFrom` is a measurement, and this path took none. `derivedGroupings` is a
 * DECLARATION, `tablesAreDerivedGroupings` on the provider's own capabilities, and a
 * declaration is as true on this path as on the other: it says the relation rows are
 * prefix groupings the server derived rather than objects anybody named, which is the
 * refusal the old flat row menu carried (standing ruling 4). It used to be omitted, and
 * what made the omission safe was a precondition nothing pinned, that no engine setting
 * the flag appears in `COMPOSED_KIND_WORDS`. Carrying it deletes the precondition instead

/**
 * The row budget a refusal named, read out of the sentence that named it.
 *
 * A regex over a message is not the shape anybody would choose, and it is the only
 * shape available: the two numbers are formatted by the PROVIDER
 * (`postgres.ts`/`sqlite.ts` both refuse rather than truncate) into a `QueryError`
 * message, and neither the error nor the tool refusal that wraps it carries them as
 * fields. Reading them here is what turns the pair from prose the model was shown into
 * data the ledger can hold — which is the whole of B54's second half, since the reason
 * code alone says "somebody said no" where the numbers say "narrow the capture".
 *
 * Anchored on the whole phrase, so the `200` in the advice sentence the tool layer
 * appends ("add LIMIT 200") cannot be mistaken for a measurement. `otherStatementAdvice`
 * in `tools.ts` reads the same message with the same anchor; the duplication is deliberate
 * rather than shared, because the two answer different questions — one composes advice
 * for a model, the other records a fact — and either may be given a different source.
 *
 * Absent when the refusal was about anything else, and absent is the honest answer:
 * this run met no budget, so a pair of zeros would be a measurement nobody took (#477).
 * The REASON CODE never depends on this function, so a message this cannot read still
 * produces a diagnosable entry — one that says "refused" without inventing a bound.
 *
 * EXPORTED so the loop can be closed by a test rather than by a comment. The hazard is
 * silent: reword the provider's sentence and this returns `undefined` for ever, the
 * ledger quietly loses the pair, and B54 re-opens with nothing going red. So
 * `tests/integration/db/sqlite-provider.test.ts` drives a REAL over-budget read through
 * `bun:sqlite`, catches the error the provider itself threw, and feeds its message
 * through here — and pins PostgreSQL's copy of the same sentence against its source.

    THE KIND IS COMPOSED HERE, NOT READ OFF THE OBJECT SURFACE (#789).

    Two facts decide this and they pull the same way. The curated object surface reaches
    the four provider methods, and every provider sends their statements through
    `provider.query`: none routes them through `queryReadOnly`, so there is no read-only
    transaction for them to arrive inside. A dialect `CATALOG_PLANS` serves is precisely
    one whose provider HAS that path, and the run's posture on it is that every statement
    it sends arrives inside `BEGIN READ ONLY` - `postgres.ts`'s connect declines even a
    bare EXPLAIN-format probe to keep that true. Taking the object read here acquired a
    second provider under `agent-operations` and sent the walk's catalog SQL outside that
    envelope, which `tests/isolated/agent-investigation-e2e.test.ts` caught as two bare
    `listContainers` statements.

    But the run must still be told what each entry IS. PostgreSQL and SQLite are the two
    engines agent mode executes on, and an inventory that hands a model a view under the
    word table, or under no word where every other engine has one, is the defect #414
    measured. So the kind is composed the way this path carries every other fact: the
    catalog statement selects the engine's own word for the relation - `pg_class.relkind`,
    joined in `composed-sql.ts`, and `sqlite_schema.type`, which that statement already
    selected and this module used to discard - and `composedKindResolver` maps it onto the
    kind id the PROVIDER declares. No provider method is called, no second provider is
    acquired, and the envelope is untouched.

    What a composed reading cannot know, it does not say: see `composedKinds`.

 * The same snapshot, read through the engine's own schema inspection (#414).
 *
 * The tables are NORMALISED before they become a snapshot: name, columns, indexes,

 * dropping them is the point rather than tidiness. The fingerprint is over the
 * schema; a row estimate is not schema, so keeping it would make an inventory change
 * identity every time somebody inserted a row — and each provider means something
 * different by the number anyway (`estimatedDocumentCount` on MongoDB, a scanned key
 * sample on Redis, `TABLE_ROWS` on MySQL). Worse, it would arrive unlabelled through
 * a path that never announced it had one, which is exactly the kind of silent claim
 * this run is not allowed to make. Statistics have their own read and their own
 * honest "this engine holds none" answer (`schema-stats.ts`).
 *
 * `finalize` is reused rather than reimplemented, so the ordering and therefore the
 * fingerprint are produced by the same code the composed path uses: two readings of
 * the same schema have to agree whichever route reached them, or `reusableSnapshot`
 * and `holdSnapshotForConnection` would reject a run's own recorded capture.
 *
 * All-or-nothing, exactly as the composed path is. A refused read, a provider that
 * could not be reached, a schema the provider rejected the request for, and a read
 * that overran its time all lose the WHOLE snapshot: a partial inventory presented as
 * complete is the failure this module exists to avoid, and it is no less one for
 * having been read a second way.
 *
 * A failure raised BEFORE the reading left becomes an unavailable capture, rather than
 * propagating and ending the run — `environmentFailure` is where that is read, and the
 * composed path asks it too now (B48). That is a decision, and the
 * reason is what plan mode promises: it opens and answers on every engine, and it did
 * on these nine before this change, because nothing was reached at all. Letting an
 * unreachable host, a wrong password, a refused `connect()` or an `ExecutionProfileError`
 * from a half-configured `agentUser` out of here would lose a plan run to an
 * IMPROVEMENT — and on the profile error it would lose it under
 * "the agent cannot run on this database engine: it offers no read-only execution
 * profile", said about an engine where plan mode demonstrably works. The user is still
 * told: the ungrounded note carries this capture's own diagnosis, so what reaches the
 * model is that the reading did not happen and why, which is the whole of what an
 * ungrounded run is owed. Anything that is NOT one of these two classes propagates —
 * a `TypeError` here is this server's bug and must not be reported to a user as a
 * property of their database.
 *
 * The COMPOSED path answers the same environment the same way, which it did not when
 * this was written: #414 left PostgreSQL and SQLite propagating such a failure on the
 * argument that they had never reached this line, and B48 is the record of a reader
 * tripping over the asymmetry. Both paths now read it through `environmentFailure`.
 *
 * Neither sentence carries the error's own message. `detail` is spliced into the note
 * a plan run reads as the server's own voice, and a driver message is text the database
 * wrote; the fenced diagnoses arrive that way from the tool layer, and these do not go

 * about any database in the world — what live runs on 2026-08-15 actually produced.
 * Since the plan-mode grounding design of that date a plan run captures its own
 * inventory when this holds none, so the hold is a fast path rather than the only
 * path, and it is filled by both modes.
 *
 * Three properties are what make that safe rather than merely cheap:
 *
 *  - **Nothing here ever reads a database.** Entries arrive only from
 *    `captureContextSnapshot`, which goes through the T6 catalog tool; this module
 *    adds no second path to an engine.
 *  - **An entry is refused unless its identity is the one its own inventory
 *    produces**, exactly as `reusableSnapshot` refuses a ledger entry. A snapshot
 *    that fingerprints as something else is not held at all, so a reader never has
 *    to decide whether to trust one.
 *  - **It is keyed by connection IDENTITY**, which is a stricter boundary than the
 *    one the run loop enforces (`RUN_CONNECTION_MISMATCH`) and deliberately so.
 *    Everyone who can open a run on a connection can read its catalog through that
 *    run anyway, so the id would have been enough for access; what it is not enough
 *    for is TRUTH. The original key was the connection id alone, and a connection
 *    record re-pointed at another database while keeping its id was served the old
 *    one's inventory. The key is now a hash over the fields that decide which
 *    database a reading came from and whose view of it (`connectionIdentity` below,
 *    #509), and it matters more now that a plan run both fills this and reads it.
 *
 * What it deliberately is NOT: durable. This is process memory, like the run-scoped
 * artifact store and for the same reason. Losing it on a restart no longer costs a
 * plan run its grounding — it costs one catalog read, because the run captures its
 * own — so what a miss buys is a statement, not the difference between a grounded

/**
 * What the run is told ABOUT the inventory, as opposed to what is in it.
 *
 * Three sentences, none of them decoration, each closing one way a model reads a true
 * list as a true statement about the database:
 *
 *  - **Incompleteness.** The bulk read bounds both the listings it issues and the objects
 *    it returns, and an absence the model was not told about is read as an absence in the
 *    database. #414 is that sentence with a run attached to it. The note says where the
 *    reading STOPPED and never that the number was a limit, because on two of the three arms
 *    it is not one: the pair bound counts listings rather than objects, and a provider whose
 *    bound is a key walk answers `details.length`, the number the reading produced (B77,
 *    measured on a LibreDB store past its 10,000-key scan cap, where the note read "stopped
 *    at a limit of 1"). `reason` is the field that says WHICH bound bit - the contract beside
 *    `truncated.limit` in `src/lib/db/types.ts` says so in those words - so it carries the
 *    discrimination and the number is left as the count it actually is. The caller-bounded
 *    number is still load-bearing and stays in the sentence: a run told 5000 objects were read
 *    can narrow its selector, and a run told nothing cannot.
 *  - **A sampled kind.** `KindCount`'s fourth state says a number is REAL but BOUNDED:
 *    Redis counts its key groupings from one `SCAN` walk, LibreDB its keyspaces from a
 *    bounded key walk. A floor reported as a total is the same defect one level down, so
 *    the kind is named with the provider's own sentence for what bounded it.
 *  - **A derived grouping.** `tablesAreDerivedGroupings` says these rows are prefix
 *    groupings this server derived, not objects anybody named, so no command can be given
 *    such a name. It is the refusal the old row menu carried, said in the one place the
 *    model actually reads. Without it, a kinded inventory would hand a run "user:* (Key
 *    Pattern)" and read as a licence to address it, which is exactly the run #414
 *    measured drafting `KEYS user:*`.
 *
 * Inside the fence with the inventory rather than in the preface, the same as the omission
 * notice already is: each one is about the lines beside it, and the bound belongs to the
 * packing that writes them.

/**
 * The part of the inventory this task is about, fenced for a prompt.

 * Bounded by construction rather than by trimming afterwards: lines are added while
 * the FENCED result still fits, so the envelope, the omission notice and the
 * marker-neutralising expansion are all inside the bound rather than added to it.
 * What does not fit is named as omitted — a model told that 34 tables exist and are
 * not shown asks for the one it needs; a model shown a silently truncated list
 * believes it has seen the schema.
 *
 * Table and column names are DATABASE CONTENT and are therefore fenced as untrusted
 * input, exactly like rows: a column comment or a table name is writable by whoever
 * can write to the database.
 *
 * A `preface` is the SERVER's own sentence, placed ahead of the fence — a caller that
 * needs to say something about the inventory (how to cite it, say) cannot say it
 * inside a region the model is told to treat as data. It is a parameter rather than
 * something a caller concatenates because the bound is this function's to keep:
 * anything prepended outside would overrun it silently, by exactly its own length.
 *
 * `omissionAdvice` is what to do about the omitted tables, and it is a parameter for
 * the same reason as the preface plus one that is a correctness matter rather than a
 * budgeting one. This notice used to end "call inspect_schema with a table selector to
 * read any of them" unconditionally, and that sentence was already false in plan mode:
 * a plan run holds no tools at all, so on a database large enough to trigger the
 * omission it was told to call something it does not have — the #350 failure, in the
 * one mode that cannot even be answered by a refusal. The tool set belongs to the
 * caller, so the caller says what can be done about the omission and a caller with no
 * tool to name says nothing. The omission ITSELF is never optional: a model shown a
 * silently truncated list believes it has seen the schema.
 *
 * `noun` is what the rows are CALLED on this engine, and it is a parameter for the
 * same reason the preface is: this function keeps the bound, so the header it counts
 * has to be the header it writes. Defaulting to `TABLE_INVENTORY_NOUN` keeps every
 * SQL engine's prompt exactly as it was — see the type's own docblock for what a
 * wrong noun cost on Redis.

 * The capture is unchanged — it is whole, all-or-nothing, held for the connection and

 * capture shared through `holdSnapshotForConnection` would be handed to a later
 * investigation run as if it were complete. What varies by workflow is the
 * PRESENTATION, and this is the operations one.
 *
 * Why these two fields and not the others. An operations objective is about what the
 * engine reports about itself, and the engine's own reports are full of schema
 * identifiers: a lock is held on a relation, an index-stats row names an index, a slow
 * query names tables. Names and index names are therefore exactly what turns an opaque
 * string in a reading into a known object. Column types are not what such an objective
 * asks about, and the relations graph is the most expensive part of the packing and the
 * least useful one here — so `packRelations` is not called for this workflow at all,
 * and this renderer carries no columns.
 *
 * An index's own columns are left out for the same reason the table's are: they are the
 * table's columns, and a reading names an index by NAME. Including them would smuggle
 * the column list back in through the part of the inventory that was kept.
 *
 * Not ranked by task relevance, unlike `packContextForTask`. An operations objective
 * rarely names a table — what it will be about is whatever the engine happens to report
 * during the run — so scoring the inventory against the objective's words would order it
 * by a signal that is not there. The snapshot's own name order is what survives, which
 * is at least stable between drives of the same run.
