/**
 * The investigation workflow (#329 T7b, epic #325): the loop that turns one
 * objective into a run, and the thing that survives the process driving it dying.
 *
 * There is ONE entry point, `runInvestigation`, and starting a run and resuming
 * one are the same call. That is not an economy — it is the whole idempotency
 * argument. A loop with a separate resume path has two implementations of "what
 * has already happened", and they drift; here, every drive begins by reading the
 * run's own ledger and re-deriving its state from it, so a fresh run is simply
 * the case where the ledger has nothing in it yet.
 *
 * Four rules make a resumed run safe to re-drive, and each is asserted in
 * `tests/isolated/agent-investigation.test.ts` rather than described:
 *
 *  1. **A step's identity is its EFFECT.** `deriveStepId` hashes the tool name with
 *     the arguments that reach the database — not the model's prose `rationale` for
 *     them — so the same call asked for twice is the same step even when the model
 *     explains it differently the second time. The run service then answers it from
 *     the ledger instead of performing it. A step id minted per call (a counter, the
 *     SDK's tool-call id) would give a resumed run a NEW id for work already done,
 *     and the duplicate execution the milestone forbids would be one confused model
 *     away.
 *  2. **A step invoked without a recorded outcome is never repeated.** That is the
 *     process-death window the write-ahead ordering creates on purpose; the loop
 *     tells the model the outcome is unknown and asks for a different statement.
 *  3. **What a resumed run knows, it reads off the ledger.** The prior-progress
 *     summary is built from the run's own events and nothing else. Results are NOT
 *     in there: rows live in the run-scoped artifact store, which is process
 *     memory (T2 forbids persisting them), so a resumed run inherits references
 *     and summaries rather than data. It is told so plainly.
 *  4. **Only a bound the run genuinely hit ends it.** Cancellation, the report, a
 *     model that stops, the turn limit and the run deadline are terminal. A
 *     transport failure, an unreachable database or any other thing outside the
 *     run's own decisions is NOT: the loop propagates it and leaves the run
 *     running, because a run left running can be resumed and a run marked failed
 *     cannot.
 *
 * Everything a tool call needs about WHO is running comes from the persisted
 * record. `AgentToolResources` is what the caller supplies, and it is the tool
 * context minus `runId`, `mode` and `actor` — the three fields the run itself
 * decides. There is therefore no parameter through which a request body could
 * choose a run's privileges or its tool set; `selectAgentTools` reads the same
 * persisted mode.

 *  - a run with no turn left to act on it, because a reminder the loop then refuses
 *    to grant rescues nothing — it rewrites a model that stopped as a run that ran
 *    out of turns
 *
 * The sentence says CALLED rather than read, because that is what this branch can
 * know: an offered tool that refused the call is still a tool this run used, and

 * it, and the rail shows a report with an empty answer pane. Measured on three models
 * (three models, one of them supported), each read the data, got a
 * result, and then went straight to `compose_report`: the reading was taken and the
 * answer was one call away.
 *
 * Said at the moment it can still be acted on. `compose_report` ENDS the run, so a
 * message delivered after it arrives too late; this one is delivered INSTEAD of that
 * call, and the call is not executed. The run then has the turn it needs to present.
 *
 * Only where all three hold, which is what keeps it from ever being a lecture: the
 * workflow presents answers, the run HAS a result this tool would accept, and the
 * model has not already tried to present one. A model that tried and was refused is
 * not hesitating about the answer — it is stuck on the payload, and telling it to
 * present again would spend the turn on a call the tool has already rejected.
 *
 * The middle one is read from the ledger the way `present_answer` reads it, and the
 * join is the whole of it: a completed `sql.query.read` whose STEP also drafted a
 * statement. The operation id alone admits `inspect_schema`, which is a catalog read
 * under that same id — real evidence, and nothing an answer can hand to an editor,
 * because the statement behind it is the server's. A run whose only reading is a
 * catalog inspection would be told to present something the tool refuses every time,

 * about to compose.

 * it is already lost — the verdict wants an answer, an answer is a reading presented, and
 * there is no reading to present.
 *
 * Measured on three models in one sweep, arriving here three different ways:
 *
 *     one model              drafted three statements, all three refused by the database,
 *                            then reported anyway

 *     a third                called nothing at all

 * operations objective is about what the engine reports about ITSELF — and #411 is the
 * finding that the argument is true about the QUESTION and false about the evidence:
 * the engine's own reports are full of schema identifiers. A lock is held on a
 * relation, an index-stats row names an index, a slow query names tables. A run that
 * has never seen the inventory reads every one of those as an opaque string.
 *
 * So the run is grounded like every other workflow, and what it is TOLD says what it
 * now has. The half of each sentence that stayed true is kept and is still
 * load-bearing: an agent-mode operations run holds no tool that sends SQL, and a plan
 * run holds no tool at all.
 *
 * NEITHER claims to be complete, and that is a correction review made on #411 rather
 * than a hedge. `packOperationsInventory` is bounded at 6000 fenced characters and drops
 * the tail — roughly 90 tables of ordinary width, which an ordinary production schema
 * exceeds — so "every table this connection holds" was the server's own unfenced voice
 * contradicting the fenced block's own omission line, and a model resolves that in
 * favour of the server. The concrete failure: a run reads `pg_locks`, finds a lock on a
 * table the packing left out, and concludes the relation is not a table of this database
 * — a confident false negative on exactly the identifier-recognition job the inventory
 * exists to do. So both notes describe a bounded list and point at the block for the
 * count, the way `packContextForTask`'s own header already states a number rather than
 * promising totality.
 *
 * Server-authored and unfenced, like the other opening messages: nothing a database
 * wrote is in it. The inventory itself arrives fenced, in its own message.

 * an operations run whose catalog read was DENIED — or whose rows were released before

 * run holds in either mode, and that is the #350 failure this pair of strings exists to
 * avoid. Nothing untrusted is spliced in — `detail` is server prose in every branch but
 * the refused read, whose engine text arrives already fenced.

 * A NEWLINE joins the diagnosis to the advice, and it is load-bearing rather than
 * formatting. `fenceUntrustedContent` ends with its terminator marker and no trailing
 * newline, so a `detail` that is a fenced database error — an ordinary outcome on the
 * twelve type-ids #414 grounds through their providers — would otherwise continue the
 * terminator line with this server's own prose. The whole point of the marker is to be

/**
 * Which ENGINE the prose plan is being written for, and what that permits it to name.
 *
 * The four workflows that write a statement have carried their engine since #396:
 * `planningStatementContract` takes the connection type and spends it on the fence tag.
 * The prose deliverable took no type at all, and `operations` is the only workflow
 * whose deliverable is prose — so a plan-mode Operate run was the one plan run in the
 * product that was never told which engine it was planning against.
 *
 * What that cost was found by driving the built branch in Chrome after #411, and it is
 * grounding that made it visible: the plans became specific without becoming right. On
 * a SQLite connection a grounded plan named the eight real tables of its inventory and
 * then proposed reading `pg_stat_user_indexes` and `pg_total_relation_size`; on a Redis
 * connection an ungrounded plan correctly said it could name no object and then
 * proposed wait event statistics, lock management views and a blocking chain
 * dependency tree. Redis has no locks and no wait events. The half of the answer the
 * user would act on was about a different database engine.
 *
 * Three constraints shape the wording, and each is a way this sentence could have gone
 * wrong:
 *
 *  - It is about the READINGS, not about the engine's name. Naming the type alone was
 *    already happening and was measurably not enough: `planningUngroundedNote`
 *    interpolates "on this redis connection" and the run that proposed lock trees had
 *    read that sentence.
 *  - It names NO tool. A plan run holds none at all, so a rule about readings that
 *    implied one could be taken would be the #350 failure this file keeps being bitten
 *    by — stated where the mode cannot satisfy it.
 *  - It promises no catalog of this engine's readings, and deliberately: a per-engine
 *    list of monitoring views written here would be a second source of truth against
 *    the kinds `inspect_operations` actually serves, and the two would drift. The rule
 *    governs what the plan may CLAIM, and the escape hatch — say what you want to
 *    establish instead — is what a model reaches for when it does not know.
 *
 * The type is a server-side enum, so nothing untrusted is spliced into a sentence the
 * model reads as the server's own; this is the same splice `planningUngroundedNote`
 * makes.
 */
const planningProseEngineRule = (type: DatabaseType): string =>
  `This database is ${type} and nothing else, so every reading you name must be one a ${type} engine actually offers: name no view, no counter and no statistic that belongs to a different engine, and where you are unsure whether ${type} exposes a reading, say what you would want to establish rather than naming a mechanism this engine does not have.`;

/**
 * Whether a reading may be written out AS a statement, and what such a statement may
 * read.
 *
 * This replaces a clause that was false and was watched being disobeyed. Both prose
 * paths used to assert "there is no statement to write here and no fenced block to
 * produce", and a plan-mode Operate run driven in a browser on 2026-08-17 — Automatic
 * classification, dvdrental, 22 tables, grounded — closed with a fenced
 * `pg_stat_user_indexes` read ordered by `idx_scan`, which the rail duly offered as
 * "Apply to editor". A rule the run visibly disobeys is the #350/#356 failure class:
 * the code asserts one thing while every live run does another, and the assertion is
 * the part that is wrong here.
 *
 * The premise the clause rested on — an operations reading is not SQL — is engine-
 * dependent, and the sentence was engine-blind. On PostgreSQL an operational reading
 * very often IS an ordinary statement: `pg_stat_user_indexes`, `pg_stat_activity` and
 * `pg_locks` are selectable objects a user can run in the editor. On Redis a reading is
 * `INFO`, `SLOWLOG GET`, `CLIENT LIST`, and on MongoDB a server-status command; there is
 * nothing to fence. So the rule states the CONDITION and lets the engine decide.
 *
 * What did NOT change, and must not: `PLAN_DELIVERABLES.operations` is still
 * `{ kind: "prose" }`. This is a permission and never a contract — no `noun`, no
 * `NO STATEMENT:` marker, no ledger fact (`recordPlanStatement` still records nothing
 * for this workflow), and no verdict that asks for a block. A plan with no block in it
 * is a complete answer, which is why that sentence is stated rather than implied: an
 * engine that expresses no reading as a statement must not read this as a bar it is
 * failing, or it produces the wrong engine's SQL to clear one.
 *
 * The last sentence is the bound that keeps this from becoming a fifth statement
 * workflow. An operations plan is not a licence to draft a query over the user's data;
 * what it may fence is what the engine reports about ITSELF. The engine half is
 * delegated to `planningProseEngineRule`, which already binds every named reading to
 * this engine — restating it here would be two wordings of one contract, which is how
 * #350 happened.
 *
 * The fence tag is the connection's canonical type-id for the reason
 * `planningStatementContract` spends it that way: `rich-text.tsx` decides from the tag
 * whether to offer the editor hand-off (#389), and a tag it does not know costs the user
 * the button. The two sentences never reach one model — the deliverable picks exactly
 * one of them — and both interpolate the same server-side enum, so the tag cannot drift

 * The same inventory, prefaced for a run that did not read it.

 * who read this. The fenced header already carries when it was read and that it has
 * not been re-read since, so the preface says the part the header cannot: whose
 * reading it was.
 *
 * Two prefaces because there are now two truths, and the wrong one is a false
 * self-description of exactly the kind this repository keeps finding. Since the
 * plan-mode grounding design of 2026-08-15 the ordinary case is that the run read the
 * inventory ITSELF, server-side, before its first turn; being handed a reading some
 * earlier run on the connection already paid for is the fast path, not the only path.
 *
 * The `earlier-run` sentence no longer says the run has read NOTHING, for the reason
 * `PLANNING_PROVENANCE` records: the statistics beside the inventory are read on both
 * paths, so the only claim that stays true on both is the one about the user's own
 * statements.
 *
 * FOUR sentences since #414, over a second axis: WHO read it, and HOW. The composed
 * arm says "a read-only catalog read the server composed", which is exactly what
 * happens on PostgreSQL and SQLite and exactly what does not happen on the nine
 * engines the provider path now grounds — there the server composes no statement at
 * all and asks the provider to describe itself, the same reading the sidebar takes
 * when it lists your tables. Leaving one sentence over both would have been this
 * surface's recurring defect stated to the model itself: a false self-description of
 * how the run came by what it knows.
 *
 * Two clauses in the provider arm that a reader will be tempted to cut, and must not:
 *
 *  - It does not claim that nothing of the DATA was touched. On MongoDB and Couchbase
 *    the provider infers a table's fields from a sample of the user's own documents,
 *    so the existence of a field here is derived from data rather than read from a
 *    catalog. No value is kept, and the sentence says which of those two it is.
 *  - It says the reading is bounded. MongoDB stops at 200 collections, Redis scans
 *    1000 keys, LibreDB 10000 — so a provider inventory can be a PARTIAL reading
 *    carrying a whole-looking table count, and a model told only "here is the
 *    inventory" would conclude a table does not exist from its absence. Nothing else
 *    in the conversation says this; the fenced header states a count, not a bound.
 *
 * The `readVia` field is optional on the snapshot and absent means `composed-catalog`,
 * for the reason `types.ts` records: every snapshot written before #414 came from that
 * path, and stamping it would have made those ledgers differ from the ones this build
 * writes for the same reading.

  Two rather than three was measured in the eval scripts: at three a run that will not comply
  pays three wasted turns before its report is allowed through. That reasoning is about the

     * drive has already read and performs no database operation at all. That is what

     * cost ceiling again (`docs/BACKLOG.md` B6), so three catalog statements out of
     * twenty would be spent per resume on rows the run already had.
     *
     * A run whose catalog cannot be read is told so and continues: the tools are
     * still there, and a narrowed `inspect_schema` is exactly what an overflowing
     * catalog needs.
     *
     * EVERY workflow reaches here, and that is what #411 changed. `operations` used to
     * return before any of this on a decision the issue re-opened: an operations
     * objective is about what the engine reports about ITSELF, so an inventory looked
     * like dead weight — until workflow inference (#407) began routing objectives here
     * that a user would expect to be answered against the schema, and until it was
     * noticed that the engine's own reports are full of schema identifiers. The
     * exclusion was one early return, and deleting it is the whole change: what remains
     * workflow-specific is which packing runs, not which path does.
     *
     * PLANNING now establishes its context the same way, and that is the one line of
     * the contract the plan-mode grounding design of 2026-08-15 deliberately changed.
     * It used to consult `heldSnapshotForConnection` and nothing else (#384), so a plan
     * run was about a real database only when an AGENT run had read one on the same
     * connection, in this same process — which is to say: never, after a restart, on a
     * second replica, or for a user who had not already used the mode this one exists
     * to be safer than. What did NOT change is the property the mode sells: a plan run
     * still runs NO statement of the user's, still writes nothing, and the model is
     * still handed no tools. It reads the catalog, which is what the sidebar does on

              the notice fires every time. `qwen3.5:9b` took the offer on one run and answered
              after six `profile_table` calls. On the runs that failed, the model heard it and

              a reading tool the optimization verdict does not accept, so narrowing there would
