/**
 * Server-side configuration for the agent runtime (#329, epic #325; availability
 * derived in #331 T5).
 *
 * Until T2 removed the NL2SQL and Autopilot panels, this module answered one
 * question — "did an operator set the flag" — and a deployment that never set it
 * still had AI. With those panels gone, `LIBREDB_AGENT_ENABLED` unset would have
 * meant **the product has no AI at all**, so the flag stopped being a feature
 * toggle and became the switch that decides whether Studio has an AI story. The
 * owner ratified deriving the answer instead
 * (github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/issues/331#issuecomment-5277689616).
 *
 * The agent is available when both of these hold, and it says which one does not:
 *
 *  - **A model is configured** — the same `LLM_*` configuration that used to power
 *    NL2SQL, resolved through `@/lib/llm`'s own `resolveConfig`/`validateConfig`
 *    rather than by reading its variables here. There is no second place to enter
 *    a key, so there must be no second reader of one either.
 *  - **The durable ledger has a writable path.** That one needs I/O, so it is not
 *    answered here — see `resolveAgentAvailability` below. It is checked for the
 *    `local` backend and deliberately NOT for `postgres`, where the only possible
 *    check is a connection attempt per page load; that carve-out is reported as
 *    one (`ledgerVerified`) rather than left to read as verified (B31).
 *
 * `LIBREDB_AGENT_ENABLED` survives as the **explicit off-switch**: its default is
 * now *auto*, and a negative value is the documented, supported way to have AI
 * configuration present and no agent. Its spelling and its negative values are
 * unchanged. An affirmative value is still accepted and still means "yes", but it
 * cannot conjure a model: deriving the answer is what keeps the surface from
 * appearing where it cannot work, and an override that renders a rail whose first
 * Start must fail would give that back.
 *
 * An unrecognised backend is **refused**, not defaulted away. The storage factory
 * can safely fall back to `local` because every value it accepts is one of its
 * own; this variable is read by the workflow runtime itself, which treats any
 * value other than its own two keywords as a MODULE SPECIFIER it require()s. An
 * allowlist is therefore the control that stops a stray value from loading
 * arbitrary code into the server, and it is also what keeps the running backend
 * equal to one of the two ratified ones.
 *
 * The variables are read from `process.env` on every call, not captured at
 * module load, so this module sees exactly what the runtime sees.
