   * argued: three DDL statements through `POST /api/db/query` added ZERO events to this ring
   * while one VACUUM on the same connection in the same minute added exactly one, so this arm is
   * the first record of a user's WRITE anywhere in this product and an operator filtering the log
   * has to be able to tell it from an editor statement.

   * The claim it makes is narrow and deliberately so: it records that an edit was applied AT THIS
   * ADDRESS, with this strategy, and with this outcome. What it does NOT claim is WHICH statements
   * the round trip carried, and the reason is measured rather than argued (D76).
   *
   * The day-one PostgreSQL unit is a multi-statement simple query with the reader's text
   * concatenated into it, and no reader in `src/lib/sql/` can count the statements in a routine
   * body: a dollar-quoted body may carry any number of semicolons and a `BEGIN ATOMIC` body
   * carries them by construction. So the count is not taken here, it is ASKED OF THE ENGINE, on
   * both sides of the plan. `buildObjectEdit` parses the reader's submitted text alone as a named
   * prepared statement inside a transaction block it has already poisoned, and refuses a text
   * PostgreSQL answers `42601 cannot insert multiple commands` for; `applyObjectEdit` counts the
   * results the round trip answered, one per statement, and reports `interrupted` with
   * `committed: "unknown"` rather than a plain `applied` when that count is not the number of
   * statements the plan is made of.
   *
   * So an `applied` event is now as wide as the write in the one way a count can make it. It still
   * says how many statements ran and never which, and it still describes one statement whose
   * effects reach past the addressed routine by the plan's own consequence list, which for this
   * strategy is empty. `docs/SECURITY.md` control 3.6 carries both limits, and this docblock is
   * the shipped source's copy of them: if one moves, move the other in the same commit.

 * /db` (a slash INSIDE the password) apart from `https://example.com/user@example/profile` (an
 * `@` INSIDE the path) — they are structurally identical. There is no syntax-only fix for that.
 *
 * The fix is to stop trying to parse a URI out of this value at all. An audit field is not a URI
 * field: nobody downstream needs the full string back, only the scheme and which host it named.
 * redactUriCredentials below finds the LAST `@` after the delimiter and keeps only what follows
 * it, discarding everything between the scheme and that point regardless of what characters it
 * contained. This is deliberately over-eager — a value shaped like case 6 above gets its path
 * mangled even though it carried no credential — and that trade is correct here: mangling a
 * harmless URL costs an operator nothing, while leaking a password costs them everything. Do not
 * "fix" this by trying to distinguish password characters from path characters; that parser cannot
 * be written correctly.
 *
 * Previously implemented as a single backtracking regex,
 * `/([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9+.-]*):\/\/([\s\S]*)$/` applied via `String.replace`. CodeQL flagged that as
 * js/polynomial-redos (alert #112): the pattern is unanchored, so `.replace` retries the whole
 * scheme-quantifier backtrack at every one of a long value's ~n starting positions before giving
 * up, which is O(n^2) on an attacker-controlled field with no length bound applied before this
 * runs (the bound below is applied AFTER redaction, deliberately - see sanitizeAuditField). Every
 * field this module processes is free text from a request body or a header value, so "attacker
 * controls the length and content" is the normal case, not an edge case.
 *
 * Rewritten below as `indexOf`/`lastIndexOf` plus one bounded scan per candidate delimiter. Why
 * this stays O(value.length) even adversarially: `:` and `/` are not URI-scheme characters, so a
 * scheme-character run can never span a "://" delimiter it failed to match against. Each loop
 * iteration's backward-then-forward scan is therefore confined to the segment strictly between the
 * previous rejected delimiter and the current one - those segments never overlap - so their
 * lengths sum to at most value.length across every iteration, however many "://" occurrences the
 * value contains. (An anchored regex, `/^([a-zA-Z]...)/`, would also kill the O(n^2) blowup, but
 * only by matching solely at index 0 - silently DROPPING redaction for a credential that arrives
 * with any prefix, e.g. an error message wrapping a connection string. That is a coverage
 * regression in a control whose entire job is to never miss a credential, so it was rejected.)

 * channel the design treats as authoritative — it calls this function directly and pushes to the
 * buffer itself. `emitAuditEvent` below is a policy built on top of this boundary, for callers
 * whose event content is decided by trusted route logic rather than by the request body.

 * js/remote-property-injection (alerts #113/#114): `key` is drawn from `Object.keys()` of an
 * object built by spreading that same admin-audit request body. Empirically, this is not currently
 * exploitable - object-spread (`{ ...event }` in that route, `{ ...event, ... }` in
 * AuditRingBuffer.push below) uses CreateDataPropertyOrThrow, which defines "__proto__" as an
 * ordinary own data property rather than invoking Object.prototype's accessor, so a later
 * `mutable["__proto__"] = ...` here only overwrites that shadow property, never the real
 * prototype. But that safety depends on both call sites staying spread-based forever; it is not a
 * property of this function. A three-name skip list costs nothing and removes the dependency.

/**
 * The single entry point for an audit event. It does exactly two things:
 *
 * 1. Pushes to the ring buffer the admin UI reads. That buffer is per process and holds 1000
 *    events, oldest dropped. It is a CONVENIENCE VIEW, not the durable record - an event emitted
 *    from proxy() may land in a different instance than the admin API reads, because the proxy is
 *    a separately compiled entry and instance sharing is unverified.
 * 2. Writes one JSON line to stdout. This is the authoritative channel: it works identically in
 *    all 27 distribution channels with no dependency, and it is what a log pipeline consumes.
 *
 * The line is NOT gated by LOG_LEVEL. Audit emission is unconditional; logger.ts remains the
 * human-readable channel and is not repurposed.
 *
 * What must never be recorded here: passwords or any credential material, JWTs, cookies or
 * Authorization values, OIDC tokens, code or code_verifier or raw claims, connection strings,
 * SSH keys, RAW SQL text, LLM prompts or responses, request bodies, raw Error.message or stack
 * traces, and arbitrary request headers. src/lib/data-masking.ts is not reusable here: it masks
 * result-grid cell values by column-name pattern and has no bearing on log strings.
 *
 * The one narrowing of that list (StorageBase fork), on `query_execution` events only: SQL text is
 * recorded MASKED - every literal replaced by `?` by src/lib/audit-sql.ts - so the trail can say
 * which statement ran without carrying the values it ran with, which are the data a log pipeline
 * must not collect. The same event names the connection's configured host and database (never a
 * credential field, never a connection string), a driver error with its quoted values masked, and
 * two named request headers: User-Agent, and X-Forwarded-For only while TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS is on.
