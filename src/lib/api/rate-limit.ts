/**
 * In-process fixed-window rate limiting.
 *
 * THIS IS A PER-PROCESS LIMITER BY DESIGN. Do not replace it with a distributed one, and do not
 * present it anywhere as one. The Helm chart defaults to replicaCount: 1 with autoscaling and the
 * PDB off (charts/libredb-studio/values.yaml:19), the Dockerfile runs a single `node server.js`,
 * and the storage abstraction (src/lib/storage/types.ts) is a per-user blob store whose
 * read-modify-write cycle is unsuitable for counters. Where the counters are per process, the
 * limits are per replica; multi-replica operators are directed to enforce at the ingress, and
 * that is documented in .env.example and charts/libredb-studio/README.md rather than implemented.
 * Do not add a dependency (e.g. Redis) to fix this - it is a deliberate scope boundary, not an
 * oversight waiting to be corrected.
 *
 * There are no timers here. A setInterval would hold the event loop open and leak one per process;
 * entries expire lazily on access instead.
 *
 * Memory bound: MAX_ENTRIES_PER_BUCKET (1000) x 5 buckets = 5000 counters total. Each counter is a
 * map entry keyed by up to MAX_KEY_LENGTH (200) UTF-16 characters (~400 bytes) plus a small
 * {count, resetAt, notified} object and Map/object overhead, so the realistic bound is roughly
 * 2.5-3 MB, not a flat "100 bytes per counter" - correct this comment again if either constant
 * changes. Nobody may add a second, unbounded map alongside these.
 *
 * Capacity is partitioned PER BUCKET, not shared across buckets: see pruneIfAtCapacity. A single
 * shared eviction pool would let an attacker flood a cheap, address-keyed bucket (login_client,
 * anon - rotate X-Forwarded-For, each rotation is a free new key) to evict entries out of a
 * different bucket (login_account) map-wide, and eviction resets a counter to zero by design. That
 * would let an attacker who just tripped login_account on a victim's account reset it for free by
 * generating unrelated traffic elsewhere - defeating the one bucket that is immune to header
 * spoofing. Partitioning makes that cross-bucket eviction structurally impossible: traffic in one
 * bucket can only ever evict entries already in that same bucket's own store.

  // routes that no longer exist. `src/lib/api/schema-route.ts`, `db/schema`, `db/schema/list`,
  // `db/schema/relations` and `db/schema-snapshot` were all removed with the object surface, and
  // the object routes it never mentioned had joined.
  //
  // RE-COUNTED 2026-09-14 (#789 Phase 3), because the sentence three paragraphs down asks by name
  // for exactly that and the object half of the count moved: the previous figure was TWENTY-THREE
  // over seven object routes, and the edit surface adds two.
  //
  // TWENTY-FIVE handlers today, and there are two ways in, which is why one grep under-counts.
  // Directly, sixteen call sites that pass bucket: "query" to guardRoute themselves
  // (grep -rl 'bucket: "query"' src/app/api/ answers sixteen files, one call site each, verified
  // with grep -rc on the same list): admin/fleet-health, db/cancel, db/disconnect, db/health,
  // db/maintenance, db/monitoring, db/multi-query, db/pool-stats, db/profile, db/provider-meta,
  // db/query, db/test-connection, db/transaction, and the three storage routes (storage,
  // storage/[collection], storage/migrate). Note db/health: only its POST is metered, because the
  // GET is the container health probe and takes no connection.
  // Indirectly, the NINE object routes under db/objects (containers, counts, list, describe,
  // search, inventory, source, edit-plan, edit-apply), which reach this bucket through
  // handleObjectRequest in object-route.ts and so carry no bucket literal of their own. Counted
  // from the route directories under src/app/api/db/objects/ and not from a grep, which is the
  // whole reason this second paragraph exists: those nine carry no literal to find. All nine
  // directories exist; this passage used to say seven did, because the count moved ahead of the
  // last two routes landing, and a reader who counts today gets nine.
  //
  // The StorageBase fork adds a SECOND indirect group: the FOUR resource routes under
  // src/app/api/resources (meta, test, health, tree), which reach this bucket through
  // handleResourceRequest in resource-route.ts and carry no bucket literal of their own, for
  // the same reason the object routes do not. Family operation routes (blob/messaging/vault)
  // join that group as they land, the same way.
  //
  // A SLOT IS NOT A UNIT OF COST HERE EITHER, and the two new routes are the sharpest example in
  // this bucket. An edit-apply slot runs DDL against a live engine; a db/pool-stats slot reads a
  // counter. They share one budget because the workload they share is a connection, and a bucket
  // per cost class would be a configurable pair per route.
  //
  // The same workload reached through a different endpoint must not get a second budget -
  // re-verify and correct this comment again if guardRoute grows a new call site.
  //
  // The storage family joined when AU1 moved it onto the shared 401 (2026-08-22), and that gave it
  // a limiter it never had. It belongs here rather than in a bucket of its own: under
  // STORAGE_PROVIDER=sqlite or postgres these routes read and write a real database, which is what
  // this bucket meters. A bucket of its own would be a fourth configurable pair for a workload
  // that is debounced write-through sync, far under 120 requests a minute in normal use.

/**
 * Takes the target bucket's own store, and only that store - never the full bucketStores map -
 * which is what makes eviction pressure in one bucket unable to reach another bucket's counters
 * (module docstring). Eviction fails OPEN - an evicted attacker key restarts at zero - because a
 * counter must never become an availability control. That is also why the cap is generous.
 *
 * CALLED BEFORE THE NEW KEY IS INSERTED, on purpose, whenever the store is already at capacity -
 * ensuring there is room for one more entry. This is load-bearing, not a style choice: a Counter
 * always starts at count 0, and 0 is the smallest a count can ever be, so if the entry about to be
 * created were itself a candidate for "lowest count", it would always win and evict itself. That
 * was this function's actual bug in an earlier version of this file: pruning ran AFTER insert, the
 * newly-inserted entry was always the unique minimum, and it always evicted itself - meaning any
 * entry that had ever reached count >= 1 became permanently immune to eviction. A bucket seeded
 * with MAX_ENTRIES_PER_BUCKET disposable decoys, each hit exactly once and audit-silent because
 * none of them trip, would then protect a REAL target forever: the target's own entry could never
 * be created, because every attempt to create it would trigger a prune that evicted the
 * just-created entry rather than a decoy. Pruning before insert removes the entry from candidacy
 * entirely, so the decoys - sitting at the bucket's actual lowest count - become the cheapest
 * victims instead.
 *
 * Two phases, in order:
 * 1. Reclaim expired entries first. They cost nothing to discard (their window is already over)
 *    and this alone is often enough, so it runs before the more expensive phase below.
 * 2. If still at capacity, evict the EXISTING entry with the LOWEST count, not the oldest by
 *    insertion. Ties (e.g. a flood of same-count decoys) resolve to the earliest inserted, because
 *    Map iteration order is insertion order and only a STRICTLY lower count replaces the running
 *    minimum - so a homogeneous flood behaves like a sliding window, always giving up its oldest
 *    member, never a genuinely different one.
 *
 * Why lowest-count and not oldest-first: an eviction policy should discard the entry doing the
 * LEAST work. A high count means that entry is actively limiting somebody; a count of one is a
 * stranger who knocked once and costs nothing to forget. Oldest-first throws away exactly the
 * wrong entry, because a determined attacker's target - the one closest to tripping - is, by
 * construction, the entry that has been sitting in the map the longest: it was created first and
 * has been accumulating count ever since. That made oldest-first eviction a bypass for the one
 * bucket (login_account) whose key is fully attacker-chosen (hmacHex of the submitted email):
 * burn a target's budget, then flood the bucket with ~1000 disposable single-guess accounts to
 * evict the target's entry and buy a fresh budget for the price of the flood.
 *
 * Lowest-count eviction (excluding the entry being inserted) does not require an attacker to push
 * decoys PAST a target's count - only to TIE it. Ties resolve to the earliest inserted (phase 2
 * above), and a real target predates every decoy raised to catch up with it, so once every OTHER
 * entry in the bucket reaches the target's own count, the target - being the earliest member of
 * that tied group - is what loses the tie-break, not a decoy. A long-established entry can lose to
 * a newer one that has merely caught up, never overtaken it. This is a known, accepted property of
 * this policy, not an oversight: the alternative tie-break (favour evicting the newest) was
 * considered and rejected, because the two earlier changes to this function's eviction rule each
 * introduced a worse flaw than the one they fixed, and the cost below is a real deterrent on its
 * own without touching the policy a third time.
 *
 * What this DOES cost the attacker: tying a target sitting at count N costs roughly
 * (MAX_ENTRIES_PER_BUCKET - 1) x N decoy requests, NOT a flat MAX_ENTRIES_PER_BUCKET - 1 - each of
 * the ~999 decoys must itself be raised from 0 to N, not merely inserted once, before the tie-break
 * can fire. At login_account's current default (20), a target one guess from tripping (N=20 -
 * decide() checks entry.count >= limit.max BEFORE incrementing, so the entry sits at count 20, not
 * 19, with one guess left in its budget) costs on the order of 999 x 20 - about twenty thousand
 * decoy requests to buy back that one guess, not "about a thousand". It is still a real, linear
 * cost multiplier over simply guessing (linear in both the bucket size and how deep the target
 * already is), and it is NOT audit-visible: catching up to a target's count never requires a decoy
 * to reach its OWN max, so no decoy bucket trips and no rate_limit_exceeded event fires. Do not
 * describe this as self-defeating or as leaving an audit trail; it does neither. (This residual
 * belongs in docs/BACKLOG.md - not added here.)
 *
 * Complexity note: this function runs once per request for a key with no live entry, before that
 * entry is created, so it is never asked to make room for more than one new arrival at a time - a
 * single full-store scan for the minimum is enough; no loop is needed.
