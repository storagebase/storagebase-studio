/**
 * @file The seal that makes a plan UNFORGEABLE while leaving it READABLE (#789 Phase 3, ruling 1a as
 * adjudicated: "opaque" means sealed, not unreadable).
 *
 * What forging buys, stated honestly, because the next reader will otherwise reduce this to
 * "arbitrary SQL execution", find it is already possible, and delete the check. On a SQL engine it
 * buys nothing against the database: MEASURED through the product with three controls, a
 * `user`-role session created and dropped a function through `POST /api/db/query`, both with an
 * inline caller-supplied connection carrying superuser credentials and with a managed seed
 * connection whose roles admit `*`. What it buys is a LIE IN THE AUDIT: the apply route records
 * the object path, the kind and the strategy and may never record the statement, so a forged plan
 * would write a true-looking row about an object that was never touched. And on Redis the premise
 * does not hold at all: that measurement covers SQL engines, so for the one non-SQL engine in the
 * day-one set this may be a genuinely new capability and the token is a real boundary.

 * cannot ordinarily outlive its issuing provider by much. The limit: a reconnect can replace the
 * instance sooner, which is why a `connection`-scoped revision needs more than a TTL and does not
 * ship. Five minutes was considered and rejected: the browser probe opened a real 975,134-character
