/**
 * A client key derived from forwarded headers.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE USING IT FOR ANYTHING ELSE. The result is a BUCKETING HINT, never an identity.
 * X-Forwarded-For is attacker-controlled, and this codebase already has the right precedent for
 * refusing to make a security decision from a forwarded header: shouldMarkCookieSecure()
 * (src/lib/auth.ts:144) will not read x-forwarded-proto to drop the Secure flag. The rule here is
 * the same with one sharper distinction - forwarded headers are used for bucketing, never for
 * authorization, and never as evidence in an audit record beyond a labelled hint.
 *
 * Why use them at all: NextRequest in Next 16 exposes no .ip and a route handler has no socket
 * address. An app that ignores forwarded headers has NO client identity, so every anonymous caller
 * collapses into one bucket - which converts the login limiter into a remote lockout switch where
 * one attacker denies login to everyone. A spoofable key is the better failure mode, and the
 * login_account bucket is the compensating control that spoofing cannot reach.
 *
 * TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS decides which of those two failure modes this deployment picked, and reads
 * through src/lib/security/config.ts's readTrustProxyHeaders() - the same warn-once bridge that
 * guards CSP_REPORT_ONLY and HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS - rather than comparing process.env directly,
 * so a typo'd value warns once and keeps the default instead of silently flipping the posture.
 * TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS answers the second failure mode directly: it names which hop in the forwarded
 * chain is this deployment's own reverse proxy, so a caller behind that proxy is bucketed on the
 * client the proxy reported rather than on the proxy itself (which would lump every user behind it
 * into one bucket and let one abuser lock out everyone else).
