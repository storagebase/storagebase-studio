/**
 * Shared request handling for the nine object routes under /api/db/objects (#789).
 *
 * One handler rather than nine copies: the guard-then-parse ordering below is a security
 * property, and nine copies of it would be nine chances for one of them to drift back to
 * parsing first. The seventh, the source read, was built on this handler rather than beside it
 * and inherited auth-before-parse, rate limiting, connection resolution and error mapping with no
 * new line of any of them. The eighth and ninth, the edit plan and the edit apply, are Phase 3's
 * and were built the same way. SEVEN became NINE with the count's own basis, which is the route
 * directories under `src/app/api/db/objects/`, and not as a bare digit: `src/lib/api/rate-limit.ts`
 * carries the same census and moved in the same commit. All nine directories exist: this sentence
 * used to say seven of them did, because the count moved before the last two routes landed.
 *
 * `route` is the same string the caller passes for error-response context, so `POST /${route}`
 * reuses it rather than threading a second, guard-specific string through every call site.
 *
 * `run` receives a THIRD argument, the request context, which the two Phase 3 routes need and the
 * seven Phase 2 routes ignore. A callback declared with two parameters satisfies a three-parameter
 * function type in TypeScript, so none of the seven existing call sites changed. It carries the
 * RESOLVED connection, which the edit-plan route hands to `connectionFingerprint`, and the
 * session, which the edit-apply route writes into its audit events, and it hands them over rather
 * than letting a route resolve either a second time: a second resolution can answer a different
 * connection, and a second `getSession` can answer a different user.
 *
 * `options.readBody` SUBSTITUTES the body read. The default is this module's own
 * `await req.json()` arm, which is what the seven Phase 2 routes use and which answers
 * `{ error: "Empty request body" }` at 400 for a body TRUNCATED by the framework at 10,485,760
 * bytes: one condition, a wrong sentence, and a defect this phase FILES rather than inherits. The
 * two Phase 3 routes pass `readBoundedJson` instead, which counts the stream and answers a true
 * sentence for each of the three conditions the default arm collapses into one. It is a
 * substitution and not a flag for the reason every seam in this module is a value: a boolean here
 * would be a second way to reach one behaviour and would put the bound's NUMBER in this file,
 * where it has no business being.

/**
 * The request body, parsed, under a BYTE bound this route holds itself (#789 Phase 3).
 *
 * THE MEASURED FACT THIS FUNCTION EXISTS FOR. There is a hard inbound bound at exactly 10,485,760
 * bytes, `DEFAULT_BODY_CLONE_SIZE_LIMIT` in Next 16.3.4's `getCloneableBody`, which exists because
 * this repository has middleware and the request body is therefore cloned for it. It TRUNCATES
 * rather than refusing, so above it `POST /api/db/query` answers HTTP 500 carrying a JSON parser's
 * message and `POST /api/db/objects/source` answers HTTP 400 `Empty request body`. One condition,
 * two wrong sentences, and NEITHER IS TRUE: the body was neither malformed by its sender nor
 * absent. A caller reading either one has no way to learn that the fix is to send less.
 *
 * TWO EVIDENCE CLASSES IN THAT PARAGRAPH, said apart so a later reader does not have to guess.
 * The CONSTANT and the TRUNCATION are read from the installed dependency and re-checkable with a
 * grep: `node_modules/next/dist/server/body-streams.js` declares
 * `DEFAULT_BODY_CLONE_SIZE_LIMIT = 10 * 1024 * 1024`, and over it `cloneBodyStream` sets
 * `limitExceeded`, pushes `null` into both streams and logs a `console.warn`, which ENDS the body
 * early rather than failing the request.
 *
 * WHERE THAT TRUNCATION IS REACHED FROM, re-measured by grep against the installed next 16.3.4 in
 * this checkout, because an earlier revision of this docblock got it backwards. `next-server.js:1289`
 * calls `getCloneableBody` on every non-upgrade request, with `experimental.proxyClientMaxBodySize`
 * as the only override, but that call only REGISTERS the wrapper on the request meta and counts
 * nothing. The count and the truncation live entirely inside `cloneBodyStream`, `body-streams.js:80`
 * to `:118`, and `cloneBodyStream` has exactly THREE call sites: `next-server.js:1210`, which is
 * inside the middleware adapter invocation, `adapterFn({ ..., page: 'middleware' })`;
 * `web/sandbox/sandbox.js:94`; and `lib/router-server.js:417` for a proxied request. So the INSTALL
 * is unconditional and the TRUNCATION is conditional on middleware actually running. The outcome for
 * this repository is the same either way, because `src/proxy.ts` IS a middleware, and the truncated
 * clone is what the route then reads: `cloneBodyStream` assigns its second stream to `buffered`, and
 * `finalize()` calls `replaceRequestBody(readable, buffered)`, which swaps the short stream onto the
 * incoming request.
 *
 * The two HTTP SENTENCES are a live measurement made earlier in this phase against a running server,
 * not something this file re-ran, and they are recorded here because they are the reason the function
 * exists.
 *
 * THE ARITHMETIC, done here rather than asserted, because the three numbers only make sense
 * together. One part is bounded at `SOURCE_CHARACTER_LIMIT`, 1,000,000 UTF-16 code units. That is
 * up to 4 MB encoded as UTF-8, because one code unit encodes to at most three UTF-8 bytes and a
 * surrogate PAIR is two code units and four bytes; and up to 6 MB once JSON-escaped, because the
 * worst-case escape of one code unit is the six ASCII bytes of `\uXXXX`. `SOURCE_PART_LIMIT` is 8,
 * so a document at its own maxima is far above any single-part figure, which is exactly why the
 * bound belongs to the CALLER'S body here and not to a per-part count: a caller submits ONE part's
 * text per request. `EDIT_BODY_BYTE_LIMIT` is 8,388,608, which sits above the 6 MB worst case and
 * below the framework's 10,485,760, so an oversized body meets a sentence here rather than a
 * truncation reported as something else downstream.
 *
 * THE COUNT IS OVER THE STREAM AND NEVER OVER `Content-Length`, and that is the whole guard. A
 * check on the header is satisfied by OMITTING the header, and a chunked body carries none: the
 * framework then truncates in silence and the caller gets one of the two wrong sentences above,
 * which is the state this function exists to make unreachable. MEASURED on bun 1.4.2 with this
 * repository's own `next` while this was written: `new NextRequest(url, { body: <ReadableStream>,
 * duplex: "half" })` constructs, its `content-length` header is `null`, and reading `req.body` to
 * completion yields 4,107 bytes for a 4,096-character payload. The same measurement also says a
 * `NextRequest` built with `body: ""` reports `content-length: null` and yields ZERO bytes, so the
 * empty-body sentence below is reached through the byte count rather than through a header.
 *
 * THREE CONDITIONS, THREE SENTENCES, which is the point of the whole function:
 * - no body at all, 400, `this request carried no body`;
 * - a body that does not parse, or parses to something that is not a JSON object, 400,
 *   `this request body is not valid JSON`;
 * - a body over the bound, 413, `this request body is larger than ${byteLimit} bytes`.
 *
 * The second condition carries a REFINED second half when the body parsed and is not an object, an
 * array or a `null` or a number. It is not a fourth condition: the caller's mistake is the same
 * one, a body this route cannot read as a set of named fields, and telling a caller who sent
 * `[1,2,3]` that its JSON is invalid would be a fourth wrong sentence in a function written to
 * remove two.
 *
 * The parse is refused rather than coerced for the reason `optionalBoolean` gives above: a body
 * that is not an object would reach `resolveConnection` as one, and an array has no `connection`
 * and no `connectionId`, so the caller would meet a connection error for a body mistake.
 *
 * WHERE THIS DIVERGES FROM `readDefaultBody`, said out loud because the two now run on the SAME
 * handler and answer differently for one body. `readDefaultBody` refuses `{}` itself, with
 * `Empty request body` at 400. This function RETURNS `{}`: it parsed, and it is a JSON object, and
 * "carries no named field this route wants" is a question for the route and not for a body reader.
 * The caller's outcome is a 400 either way, because `resolveConnection({})` raises
 * `Either connection or connectionId is required` at 400, so this is a difference in SENTENCE and
 * not a hole. Both halves are pinned: the empty object is returned in
 * `tests/unit/lib/api/object-route-edit.test.ts` and both end-to-end answers are measured through
 * this handler in `tests/api/db-objects.test.ts`, under
 * `describe("the body read the handler actually performs")`. They live in that file because it is
 * where this handler's end-to-end answers are measured. The original reason has since expired: a
 * SECOND `mock.module("@/lib/db", ...)` in one bun process broke the real module graph for the
 * files that mocked `@/lib/db/factory` later, and a separate file carrying the same mocks took
 * `bun test tests/api` from 558 pass / 0 fail to 510 pass / 5 fail with 5 `SyntaxError: Export
 * named 'getOrCreateProvider' not found` errors. `bun run test` now runs every test file in its
 * own process, so two files can hold that mock without meeting each other; the hazard is only
 * within a file now.

/**
 * The answered document under the route's OWN bound (#789 Phase 2).
 *
 * The route ENFORCES rather than trusts, which is the shipped precedent and not a new rule: the

 * callers behind this one are the sixteen providers that implement `readObjectSource`, and the
 * route materialises the whole answer and serialises it in one `NextResponse.json`, so this is the
 * one place a memory bound can actually be held. A number merely PASSED to an implementation is a
 * request, not a bound.
 *
 * CORRECTED after review, because the first version of this paragraph named a caller that cannot
 * reach it. MEASURED: `handleObjectRequest` takes its provider from `getOrCreateProvider`, which
 * resolves through a closed `switch (connection.type)` in `src/lib/db/factory.ts` with no
 * registration point for anyone else, and the embedded shell has no API routes at all, so a host
 * implementing the workspace source seam reads through its own function and never through this
 * module. The bound is here for a PROVIDER defect, which is enough on its own.
 *
 * A provider that bounded correctly is returned unchanged, which is what makes the walk safe to
 * run on every answer. A provider that bounded at its own SMALLER limit is also unchanged, because
 * its text already fits. Only a provider that over-answered is sliced, and its own sentence is
 * KEPT and joined rather than replaced: a second bound is a second fact.
 *
 * `parts.length` is bounded too, because the tuple type has no upper bound and the real response
 * size is `limit` times the part count. `SOURCE_PART_LIMIT` is four times the largest shape any
 * engine in the fleet produces, so no correct provider can reach it and a provider that does is a
 * defect rather than a database fact.
 *
 * The EMPTY document is refused by name rather than left to the destructuring below. `parts` is a
 * non-empty tuple in the type and a JavaScript caller is not held to it, and MEASURED before this
 * guard existed, `parts: []` reached `"unavailable" in part` on `undefined` and raised
 * `TypeError: part is not an Object`, which `createErrorResponse` reports as an unhandled error
 * rather than as the caller's mistake it is.

 * THE THIRD ARGUMENT is the CONNECTED provider's capabilities, and it is what makes the edit
 * affordance a route-enforced fact rather than a provider-reported one (#789 Phase 3). Same
 * precedent as the paragraph above: a declaration merely READ from an implementation is a report
 * and not a bound. A provider that offers `edit` on a part whose kind it never declared
 * `acceptsSourceEdits` would ship a client an Edit button for an object no `buildObjectEdit` can
 * plan, and the user would meet the refusal after typing rather than before.

/**
 * The `edit` affordance, kept or DELETED, decided by the route and never by the provider (#789).
 *
 * THREE reasons to delete it, and they are checked in this order because each is a different fact:
 *
 * 1. THE PART IS A REFUSAL. Representable and not hypothetical: MEASURED against tsc 6.0.3 and
 *    already recorded on `boundPart` above, the excess-property check on a union admits any
 *    property declared on ANY member of it, so a part carrying `unavailable` BESIDE `edit`
 *    compiles with no cast. A provider spreading a conditional affordance onto a refusal would
 *    ship an editable refusal: a client narrows it to the refusal arm, draws "this could not be
 *    read", and offers an Edit button over the text it just said it does not have.
 * 2. THE PART IS TRUNCATED, whether the PROVIDER marked it or `boundText` just did. A truncated
 *    part is a PREFIX, and submitting a prefix back replaces the object with the part of itself
 *    the reader was shown, which is ruling 1b's second clause: a SUCCESS destroying something the
 *    user was not shown. It is the server-side half of the pair that closed backlog entry X17: the
 *    CAPTION tells a human that a bounded text is not whole, and THIS tells the machine not to
 *    offer an edit over it. X17 is closed, so the id no longer resolves and the pairing is named
 *    here instead. It WITHDRAWS THE OFFER; it does not make the submission impossible, and
 *    the write-path paragraph below says whose job that is.
 * 3. THE KIND IS NOT EDITABLE ON THE CONNECTED PROVIDER, by `kindAcceptsSourceEdits`. This is D57,
 *    the defect where a client's declaration can be a different server's, closed on the read path:
 *    the affordance travels with the document from the server that answered it.
 *
 * WHICH OF THE THREE RULES HAS A LIVE PRODUCER TODAY, measured by grep at this commit rather than
 * implied by the fact that all three are tested. This paragraph counted ONE producer when PostgreSQL
 * was the only engine that had landed; the day-one set is now three and the count was re-measured
 * rather than the digit bumped, because what it counts is what the paragraph is for.
 *
 * There are THREE producers of `edit`: `providers/sql/postgres.ts:3145`, gated on
 * `kindAcceptsSourceEdits(capabilities, kind)`; `providers/sql/trino/index.ts:1257` and
 * `providers/keyvalue/redis.ts:1867`, both gated on `spec.acceptsSourceEdits === true`, which is the
 * same fact read through the same declaration. All three sit on the READABLE arm, verified rather
 * than assumed: no producer attaches `edit` to a part carrying `unavailable`.
 *
 * So rules 1 and 3 still have NO live producer, and for the same reason as before: the only thing
 * that can build their population is a DEFECTIVE or a future provider, and the unit tests construct
 * it deliberately, which is this module's own ENFORCE-rather-than-trust precedent and not an
 * oversight.
 *
 * Rule 2's producer set GREW and its character changed, which is the part a bumped digit would have
 * hidden. On PostgreSQL it is a by-product: that site spreads `truncated` and `edit` from a single
 * read, so a routine over `SOURCE_CHARACTER_LIMIT` reaches it. On Redis it is a DECIDED POSITION,
 * stated at `redis.ts:1860-1866`: the affordance is offered on a truncated part deliberately, because
 * the bound is the CALLER's and the same object read without one is whole, so a provider that withheld
 * it there would be answering a property of the REQUEST as a property of the object. Rule 2 is what
 * makes that position safe on the standalone path, and the pane's predicate and `buildObjectEdit`'s
 * re-read are what make it safe on the other two.
 *
 * THE WRITE PATH IS NOT COVERED HERE AT ALL, and it never can be. Deleting a field from a READ
 * response cannot bind a caller: a client that never calls `/api/db/objects/source`, or that simply
 * ignores the field that was deleted, can POST the truncated prefix straight to the edit routes.
 * That was an obligation ON THE EDIT-PLAN ROUTE and BOTH HALVES OF IT HAVE LANDED, so what follows
 * names the enforcer of each half and where it sits, MEASURED by grep at this commit.
 *
 * THE KIND, at `src/app/api/db/objects/edit-plan/route.ts:89`: that route calls
 * `requireEditableKind(provider.getCapabilities(), kind, ...)` before it reaches the builder, on the
 * CONNECTED provider and never on the client's copy of the declaration, and its comment there cites
 * this docblock by name as the reason. `src/app/api/db/objects/edit-apply/route.ts:141` asks the same
 * question of the plan's kind, so neither half of the write path takes a caller's word for it.
 *
 * THE BOUND, on both sides of the same constant. `edit-plan/route.ts:74` refuses a SUBMITTED text
 * longer than `EDIT_CHARACTER_LIMIT`, and all three day-one providers refuse a READ definition longer
 * than it inside `buildObjectEdit`: `providers/sql/postgres.ts:3302`, `providers/keyvalue/redis.ts:1957`
 * and `providers/sql/trino/index.ts:1451`. The second is what closes the class rather than narrowing
 * it: a plan is minted only from the build's own read, so a definition the pane could only have shown
 * truncated never reaches a plan at all, whatever the client POSTs.
 *
 * EVERY `path:line` ABOVE IS PINNED BY A TEST, because "measured at this commit" is a claim that
 * expires at the next one and nothing in CI reads a code comment. One of these pointers rotted by
 * twelve lines inside the very branch that wrote this paragraph, from an insertion above it in the
 * provider file it names. `tests/unit/lib/api/object-route-edit.test.ts` greps the anchor each citation
 * means, derives the number this docblock must be writing and fails with it, so a correct
 * renumbering costs nothing here and a stale one cannot reach `main`.
 *
 * So this function decides what the UI is OFFERED, and the two edit routes decide what the server
 * ACCEPTS.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT COVER ON THE READ PATH ITSELF, said out loud rather than left for a reader to
 * assume the opposite.
 * It kills the class on the ROUTE path ONLY. A HOST cannot reach here at all, MEASURED and already
 * recorded on `boundSourceDocument`: `handleObjectRequest` takes its provider from
 * `getOrCreateProvider`, which resolves through a closed `switch (connection.type)` in
 * `src/lib/db/factory.ts` with no registration point for anyone else, and the embedded shell has
 * no API routes, so a host implementing the workspace source seam answers its document straight to
 * the pane. The EMBEDDED half is the client-side predicate in
 * `src/components/object-source/source-editable.ts`, which asks the same three questions of the
 * document it was handed. Two halves, deliberately, because neither one covers the other's
 * population.
 *
 * The delete is a REST SPREAD and not a `delete` statement, so the answered part is a new object
 * and the provider's own is not mutated. `Object.hasOwn` and never `in`, on standing ruling 5g,
 * and never `part.edit !== undefined`: a part carrying an explicit `edit: undefined` has the key,
 * and `JSON.stringify` would drop it anyway, but a reader asking "does this part offer an edit"
 * gets the same answer either way only while the question is asked about the KEY.
