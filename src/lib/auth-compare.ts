/**
 * Constant-time credential comparison.
 *
 * crypto.timingSafeEqual requires two ArrayBufferViews of EQUAL byte length and throws otherwise.
 * Attacker guesses and real passwords almost never share a length, so calling it on raw strings
 * throws on nearly every wrong guess - and the obvious guard, `if (a.length !== b.length) return
 * false`, reintroduces exactly the length oracle this control exists to remove. Comparing
 * fixed-length digests makes both operands 32 bytes regardless of input, so one timingSafeEqual
 * call always runs on equal-length buffers.
 *
 * HMAC with a per-process random key rather than a bare digest, so the digests are unpredictable
 * to an attacker who can submit inputs. The key is a lazy module-level singleton, matching the
 * _jwtSecret pattern in src/proxy.ts:14-20. Unlike that one, the memo here is load-bearing rather
 * than an optimization: the key is generated, not read, so re-deriving it per call would make two
 * digests of the same input differ.
 *
 * node:crypto is unconditionally available: no route declares an edge runtime and production runs
 * `node server.js`.
