/**
 * The single answer to "which stored fields are credentials".
 *
 * Why these are `Record<keyof T, FieldClass>` maps and not a list of secret field names: lazy
 * migration only re-writes what it reads, so a credential-bearing field nobody remembered to add
 * to a list stays in the clear forever in every existing deployment. A list fails silently. These
 * maps fail at `bun run typecheck` - add a field to DatabaseConnection, SSLConfig or
 * SSHTunnelConfig and the object literal below stops satisfying its type until the new field is
 * classified. A field has to opt OUT of scrutiny, deliberately; there is no opt-in step to forget.
 *
 * `nested` marks a container whose own map carries the classification, so "I did not think about
 * it" and "it is a container" are different answers rather than the same silence.

/**
 * Every classification map in this module, in one place, so a consumer that needs "which fields
 * does this product classify as credentials" imports one name instead of restating three.
 * (src/lib/agent/state-guard.ts derives its credential-key set from it.)
 *
 * Note what this is NOT: unlike the maps above, it carries no compile-time guarantee. The maps
 * fail `bun run typecheck` when a field goes unclassified; nothing makes a FOURTH map appear in
 * this array. Adding one is a manual step, and the direction that loses coverage silently is
 * ADDING a map without registering it - the storage layer would encrypt the new field while a
 * consumer deriving from this array never learns it exists. So the check that covers this lives in
 * tests/unit/lib/agent/state-guard.test.ts and is reflective, not a pinned list of names: it walks
 * this module's own exports and fails when one of them is a classification map this array omits.
 *
 * That check sees EXPORTED maps only. A fourth map kept module-private and wired straight into
 * `walkConnection` is invisible to it, and would be sealed here while a consumer persisted it in
 * the clear. Export any new classification map (all three above are) and the check covers it;
 * recorded in docs/BACKLOG.md so the gap is tracked rather than only described.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT consumed by this module's own encrypt/decrypt walk. The three maps are not
 * interchangeable there - each applies at a different level of a connection (root, `ssl`,
 * `sshTunnel`), which a flat array cannot express - so making `walkConnection` iterate it would
 * mean encoding those locations too, i.e. redesigning the walk rather than deduplicating a list.
