 * Credential encryption, applied ABOVE the ServerStorageProvider boundary.
 *
 * Why here and not inside each provider: one implementation means sqlite and postgres cannot
 * drift, a third provider inherits the control instead of having to remember it, and the
 * ciphertext stays portable so copying rows from a SQLite store into PostgreSQL still opens.
 * Neither shipped provider knows this exists; both simply receive a connection list whose secret
 * fields are already sealed and JSON.stringify it into their `data` column.
 *
 * Only `connections` is touched. No other collection carries a credential field: history and
 * saved_queries hold SQL text (the product's data, not its secrets), audit_log is already
 * sanitized by src/lib/audit.ts, and the remaining eight hold metadata.
