// SSH tunnel rewrite (#457, X23)
// ============================================================================

/**
 * The connection a provider is built with when its traffic goes through an SSH tunnel: `host`
 * and `port` point at the tunnel's LOCAL endpoint, which is where the driver must dial, and the
 * address that endpoint FORWARDS TO, read back off the tunnel, travels with them under
 * `TUNNEL_FAR_END`.
 *
 * The far end is carried because the rewrite alone made the whole tunnelled population unable to
 * edit anything (X23). A provider seals every object edit plan with
 * `connectionFingerprint(this.config)` and the edit routes recompute that digest from the record
 * the request resolved, so a config that says `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>` and a record that says
 * `db.internal:5432` compared unequal on every attempt: the reader could open the object, could
 * read it, and could never edit it.
 *
 * It is NOT on `ProviderOptions`, for the reason `ProviderExecutionContext`'s docblock already
 * gives about a profile flag: options are caller-supplied and flow all the way into
 * `getOrCreateProvider`, and a value the seal depends on must not be settable by whoever builds
 * the options for a request. A symbol key is the same footing reached differently - see
 * `TUNNEL_FAR_END` in `src/lib/types.ts` for what stops a stored connection carrying one.
 *
 * `base` is the connection as the caller already holds it - `acquireExecutionProfileProvider` has
 * substituted the agent credential onto it by the time it gets here - and only `host` and `port`
 * are replaced. The far end is not read off it at all, which is the point of the paragraph below.
 *
 * THE FAR END COMES OFF THE TUNNEL, never off the record, and that is why this helper takes no
 * separate `farEnd` argument (D86). A pooled tunnel is not always the one this call opened, so
 * the address the caller ASKED to forward to and the address the forward reaches are two
 * different facts. MEASURED 2026-09-15 against the live bastion, no mocks: with the pool keyed
 * on the connection id alone, a provider built on the id of a tunnel to `pg-p3fix:5432` with the
 * record changed to `db-elsewhere.invalid:6543` dialled the existing forward, answered
 * `libredb_dev` at `172.23.0.2`, and sealed `db-elsewhere.invalid:6543` - which is exactly what
 * the edit routes recompute, so that plan verified against a machine the statement never reached.
 * Two things closed it: `TunnelInfo` now carries `remoteHost`/`remotePort`, and the pool keys on
 * them and on the bastion route, so a request for a forward nothing has opened opens its own.

/**
 * Run `run` against a connection reachable through its SSH tunnel, then close the
 * tunnel unconditionally.
 *
 * This is the transport for callers that build a provider with
 * `createDatabaseProvider` directly - outside both provider caches - and connect it:
 * `POST /api/db/test-connection` and `POST /api/db/schema-snapshot`. Before #457 they
 * connected to the raw database host, so a tunnelled connection could never be tested
 * and therefore never be saved at all (the dialog gates its only save button on a
 * passing test), and the agent's grounding capture could not read a tunnelled schema.
 *
 * The tunnel is deliberately NOT pooled, unlike `getOrCreateProvider`'s. Those callers
 * cache nothing, so nothing would ever evict a pooled tunnel: `removeProvider` and the
 * idle sweep close the tunnel of a CACHED provider, and the connection dialog mints a
 * fresh id for every unsaved build - so each test click would strand an SSH client and
 * a listening local server for the life of the process. Ownership sits with this scope
 * instead, which is why `run` is a callback rather than a returned endpoint: the close
 * cannot be forgotten.
 *
 * The callback is NOT named `use`: `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` reads a call to
 * anything named `use()` as React 19's hook and rejects it outside a component, and
 * inside a try block on top of that.
 *
 * A connection with no tunnel, or with no host and port to forward to (a
 * connection-string connection, or SQLite), passes straight through untouched - the
 * same rule the pooled paths apply.

 * while the dialog tests the edited copy under a fresh id). The type is in the key so

 * directory, so two unrelated in-memory connections came out with ONE identity and the
 * second borrowed the first's open handle - reading a database nobody pointed it at.
 * It fires on the engines that declare `singleWriterFile`, which is where the borrow
 * lives: DuckDB accepts `:memory:` (LibreDB does not). An anonymous in-memory database
 * is per-handle by definition - there is no file to share, no lock to work around, and
 * therefore nothing a borrow could buy.
 *
 * The comparison is EXACT, matching `DuckDBProvider.getDatabasePath()` character for
 * character: that method treats `:memory:` and nothing else as in-memory, and resolves
 * every other spelling - `:MEMORY:`, ` :memory:`, DuckDB's own `:memory:named` - as a

 *
 * Deliberately reads only the writable cache. The reverse direction - handing an

 *
 * The cost of that is real and is paid by the editor. If an agent run reaches a

 * opens the file and caches the handle under the PROFILED key; `getOrCreateProvider`
 * then fails on the lock, so browsing that connection in the sidebar is refused until

    The single-writer exception (B49), and why it is safe HERE and nowhere else.

    On an engine that declares `singleWriterFile` the file admits one open handle, so
    opening a second one for this acquisition does not produce a less privileged
    handle - it throws, and the run continues silently ungrounded (a `ConnectionError`
    becomes an unavailable capture). Every agent grounding read on a LibreDB
    connection was lost that way from the moment anyone browsed it in the sidebar.

    Two bounds keep the isolation invariant intact. It is scoped to the profile that
    sends NO statement of the model's: `agent-operations` calls the curated reporting
    methods only, so there is nothing here for a read-only statement path to bound,
    and `agent-read-only` / `agent-handover` are still refused on such an engine
    rather than served the writable handle. And it is refused when the connection
    configures an agent credential, because the borrowed handle was opened under the
    connection's own - a reuse cannot silently substitute one principal for another.

    The provider is returned WITHOUT being cached under the profiled key: it is
    borrowed, and an entry there would let this cache's idle sweep - or a
    `removeProvider` for any connection sharing the file - close the file under the
    session that opened it.
