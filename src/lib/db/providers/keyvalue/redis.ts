 * The two kinds this engine has, and the three candidates that are deliberately absent.

 * `keyspace` is the grouping `getSchema()` has always produced: a bounded `SCAN` of 1000
 * keys, collapsed to one row per prefix. Those rows are this server's own summary and NOT
 * objects anybody named, which is what `tablesAreDerivedGroupings` says, and the
 * declaration carries that refusal forward - see the note on that flag in
 * `getCapabilities()`.
 *
 * `function` is a real, named, stored object: a Redis 7.0 FUNCTION library is persisted,
 * replicated, listed by `FUNCTION LIST` and addressed by its `library_name`
 * (`FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME <name>` answers it and nothing else, measured). It declares
 * `hasSource`, and it is the only thing in this engine that can: `FUNCTION LIST WITHCODE`
 * answers the library's Lua source verbatim, shebang line included.
 *
 * Three candidates are absent on purpose:
 *
 * - An `EVAL` script is not enumerable. Redis publishes `SCRIPT EXISTS <sha>`, which
 *   answers about a sha the caller already has, and there is no `SCRIPT LIST`. A tree node
 *   is something that can be listed, so a kind here would draw a folder that could never
 *   fill.
 * - A keyspace notification is pub/sub, not a stored trigger: nothing is persisted and
 *   nothing has a name.
 * - The separately named "Triggers and Functions" feature is RedisGears-based, ships only
 *   in Redis Stack and Enterprise, and is on Redis's own deprecated list. Declaring it
 *   would draw a folder on every plain server that has no such concept at all.
 *
 * The list is STATIC, and one measurement is what decides that it has to be. Three of the
 * four Redis-wire relatives refuse `FUNCTION LIST` outright, each in its own words
 * (measured 2026-09-11): KeyDB 6.3.4 "ERR unknown command `FUNCTION`, with args beginning
 * with: `LIST`, ", DragonflyDB df-v1.40.1 "ERR Unknown subcommand or wrong number of
 * arguments for 'LIST'. Try FUNCTION HELP." and Garnet 2.1.5 "ERR unknown command";
 * Valkey 9.1.1 (which reports `redis_version:7.2.4`) supports it. A version-driven declaration, the shape `mysql.ts` uses, would
 * be WRONG here rather than merely awkward: DragonflyDB reports `redis_version:7.4.0` and
 * still has no `FUNCTION LIST`, so the version cannot answer the question. `countObjects`
 * therefore carries the server's own sentence under `{ unavailable }`, which is the state
 * `KindCount` has for a refused read, and the folder says why it has no number instead of
 * showing a zero nobody measured.

 *   `libredb_probe`, replaced `LIBREDB_PROBE` and left `libredb_probe` answering `pong`. So this

   * `getOrCreateProvider` caches this provider per `connection.id` for the whole process,
   * so a `MULTI` a script sent through `query()` and never finished belongs to whoever
   * borrows the handle next. MEASURED 2026-09-15 on redis 7.4.11 through ioredis 5.11.1:
   * after a bare `MULTI`, every later command on that connection answers the string
   * "QUEUED" and does nothing - `SET`, `GET` and even `CLIENT INFO` alike - while a second
   * connection is untouched. So the next user's command does not fail, it silently does
   * not happen, and the schema explorer's `SCAN` is queued with it.
   *
   * THE ASK IS THAT SUBSTITUTION, AND IT IS NOT THE ACT. ioredis publishes no transaction
   * state for a `MULTI` sent through `call()` (`status` stays "ready", and the queueing
   * belongs to `Redis.prototype.multi()`'s pipeline object, which a raw command never
   * touches), so the server has to be asked - but a queued reply IS the server answering.
   * `PING` answers "PONG" outside a `MULTI` and "QUEUED" inside one, so one command with a
   * known reply of its own reads the state without changing it.
   *
   * Asking first is not a refinement, it is what keeps an ordinary connection working.
   * MEASURED on the same server: a read-only ACL (`+@read +ping +info`) answers "PONG" to
   * `PING` and "NOPERM User ro has no permissions to run the 'discard' command" to
   * `DISCARD`, and cannot run `MULTI` at all. `POST /api/db/multi-query` awaits this call
   * in a `finally`, so a blind `DISCARD` would turn every request on such a connection into
   * an error response and throw away the statement results it had already earned. With the
   * ask first, no `DISCARD` is sent unless there is one to send. The narrower ACL that CAN
   * open a `MULTI` but not discard it (`+@read +ping +multi +set`, measured) still raises,
   * and must: that transaction is open and this provider cannot end it.
   *
   * `DISCARD` and not `EXEC`, for the reason at `OpenQueryTransactionOutcome`: a script
   * that queued commands and never said `EXEC` did not ask for them to run.
   *
   * THE `scope` PARAMETER IS DECLARED ON THE INTERFACE AND IGNORED HERE, deliberately (D87). It
   * exists so a provider that borrows a DIFFERENT pooled client per call can name the one the
   * caller's own statements ran on; this provider holds ONE cached connection for its whole life, so
   * there is no other client to name. A signature that took it and did nothing with it would only
   * suggest the question had been considered per call, which it has not.
   *
   * WHAT THAT DOES NOT MEAN: that the transaction ended here is the caller's own. It is the clearest case of the three
   * providers that ignore this parameter. A `MULTI` is state of the CONNECTION, and this provider
   * has one for every concurrent request on the stored connection, so `POST /api/db/query` running
   * this in its `finally` PINGs and, on `QUEUED`, `DISCARD`s whatever `MULTI` is open there, whoever
   * opened it. A plain `GET` typed by one user therefore drops a `MULTI` another user had just
   * queued commands into, and that user is told nothing: their next command answers `QUEUED` from
   * no transaction. The `DISCARD` catch below already half-knows this, since "another caller on
   * this shared connection ended it in between" is the same collision seen from the other side.
   * It is the D87 shape on a single connection and it is NOT closed: closing it needs the `MULTI`
   * owned by a call scope rather than by the connection, which is a design change and not a
   * parameter, so it is filed rather than worked around here.

   * Why the join character is a newline and not a space: the tokenizer's

   * A function library answers three empty arrays with NO round trip. That is a true fact

   *
   * THE TWO KINDS ARE DELIBERATELY ASYMMETRIC ABOUT EXISTENCE, and this is the reason. A
   * `function` path describes successfully for ANY name, because nothing here reads the
   * catalog to answer it; a `keyspace` path whose grouping the current scan no longer holds
   * RAISES below. Existence is not the same question on the two kinds: a key grouping is
   * derived from a scan, so it ceases to exist the moment its last key is deleted and an
   * empty shape would claim a grouping that is gone, while a library's detail at this depth
   * is a property of the KIND rather than of the object and is correct without asking. Paying
   * a `FUNCTION LIST` round trip here only to raise would buy a check nothing in Phase 1 shows
   * a person. Phase 2 is where the two must agree: its Source tab reads
   * `FUNCTION LIST WITHCODE LIBRARYNAME <name>`, which is a round trip that can miss, and it
   * misses QUIETLY: measured on redis 8.10.1, `FUNCTION LIST LIBRARYNAME no_such_library`
   * answers an empty array rather than an error, so whatever reads it has to treat emptiness as

   * `FUNCTION LIST WITHCODE` answers a library's whole Lua source. Redis publishes no surface
   * that writes one registered function.
   *
   * THE STRATEGY IS `replace-in-place-command` AND THE PREVIEWABLE UNIT IS A COMMAND, which is
   * why {@link ObjectEditUnit} has two arms at all. The apply is
   * `FUNCTION LOAD REPLACE <library code>`, and MEASURED on redis 8.10.0 its reply is the library
   * NAME the server read out of the shebang. Rendering that as pseudo-SQL would be a lie about
   * what runs.
   *
   * RULING 1b, BOTH AXES, MEASURED on 8.10.0 in a container created for this task:
   * - A FAILURE CANNOT LOSE THE OBJECT. Four refusal shapes were measured, a compile error
   *   (`ERR Error compiling function: user_function:5: '=' expected near 'local'`), a body
   *   registering nothing (`ERR No functions registered`), a missing shebang
   *   (`ERR Missing library metadata`) and an unknown engine (`ERR Engine 'moon' not found`), and
   *   after every one of them `FCALL libredb_ping 0` still answered `pong`.
   * - A SUCCESS CAN DESTROY SOMETHING, which is the second axis and the reason
   *   {@link ObjectEditPlan.consequences} is filled here. `REPLACE` replaces the WHOLE LIBRARY:
   *   measured, a body carrying only `libredb_ping` loaded successfully, answered
   *   `"libredb_probe"`, and `FCALL libredb_echo_key` then answered `ERR Function not found`. The
   *   sibling was deleted and success was reported.
   *
   * THE COLLATERAL READ RUNS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AND IS NOT CONDITIONAL ON ANYTHING. It is the
   * same round trip that reads the definition, so it costs nothing, and running it only when
   * something already suspects a collateral would be a guard whose loop never sees the negative
   * case: `consequences: []` would never be produced and the empty arm would be dead. The
   * fixture holds one library of each shape for exactly this, `libredb_probe` with two
   * registered functions and `LIBREDB_PROBE` with one, and they are also the pair that proves
   * the byte-for-byte selection, because `LIBRARYNAME` is a CASE-INSENSITIVE glob over a
   * CASE-SENSITIVE dictionary.
   *
   * NO LUA PARSER IS INVOLVED ANYWHERE, here or in the apply. The warning says what the library
   * REGISTERS TODAY, which is a catalog fact, and never what the submitted text will register,
   * which would be a prediction from a Lua source this provider does not evaluate.
   *
   * THREE REFUSALS, IN THIS ORDER, and each one answers before anything is sent.
   *
   * A READ THE SERVER REFUSES RAISES rather than becoming a refusal, which is the one asymmetry
   * with `readObjectSource`: a NOPERM on `FUNCTION LIST` leaves this method knowing nothing about
   * the object, so there is no plan to issue and no fact a refusal could carry. The pane's own
   * read has already reported that sentence in the part it draws.

   *    this design does sits between the comparison and the write. A library that moved is a
   *    `conflict` and NOTHING is executed. It NARROWS the window and does not close it: another
   *    session can still load between this read and the next round trip, and no transaction on
   *    this engine spans the two.
   * 2. the LOAD. Its reply is the library name the server read out of the shebang, MEASURED, and
   *    that name is compared against the addressed one. That comparison is a CONTROL rather than
   *    the primary guard, because the build's shebang check already refused a text naming
   *    another library: what it catches is a shebang-extraction bug in this file, and the arm it
   *    reaches is `applied-elsewhere` with the server's own reply in `wrote`. `undone` is FALSE,
   *    because Redis offers this design nothing to take it back with and it will not issue a
   *    `FUNCTION DELETE` of its own.
   * 3. the RE-READ AFTER, which supplies the NEW revision token and answers the collateral
   *    question. `lost` is a catalog fact read AFTER the write and never a restatement of the
   *    warning: the plan said what WOULD be lost, this says what WAS.

  /**
   * Columns for EVERY object of one kind in one database, from ONE walk (#789).
   *
   * ONE WALK for the whole folder, which is the entire reason this method exists. Nothing
   * here sends a statement, so the N+1 the inventory route removed does not come back as
   * round trips: `describeObject` runs a full `scanKeyGroups` walk of its own, and a body
   * looping it would walk the keyspace once per grouping. The suite counts the driver's
   * `SCAN` calls, which is the only observable difference between the two.
   *
   * A FUNCTION LIBRARY HAS NO COLUMNS, so its folder answers `{ details: [] }` and sends
   * NOTHING - not even the `FUNCTION LIST` the listing needs. That is the reference's fourth
   * guard and it is the same fact `describeObject` already answers for one library: a library
   * has no columns, no indexes and no foreign keys, and its SOURCE, the one thing it does
   * have, is Phase 2's through `FUNCTION LIST WITHCODE`. It is a true statement about the
   * KIND rather than a refused read, so it is an empty batch and not a throw.
   *
   * A kind this provider declares and cannot enumerate is a different fact again, and it
   * RAISES: "this kind has no columns" and "this file has no reader for this kind" must not
   * arrive as the same empty answer, because only the second is a defect. The refusal is
   * `listIn`'s own, so the two methods refuse by one rule.
   *
   * TWO BOUNDS, AND THE ANSWER NAMES WHICHEVER BIT. The caller's `limit` is applied to the
   * sorted groupings and reports the caller's own number. The walk's 1,000-key budget is a
   * bound this provider did not choose on this call, and it is reported too, on an unbounded
   * read as readily as on a bounded one, because a cap nobody can see is the defect
   * `truncated` exists to prevent. It cannot bite on the `function` folder, which sends
   * nothing, so the marking is per KIND here exactly as it is in `countObjects`.
   *
   * THE CUT IS OURS, BECAUSE THIS ENGINE OFFERS NOTHING TO CUT UNDER. `SCAN` publishes no
   * order at all and its bound is on KEYS rather than on groupings, so there is no `limit + 1`
   * to push down: a walk cannot know how many groupings it will produce until it has finished.
   * The membership of a bounded read is therefore `comparePaths`' and this provider says so
   * rather than implying an order the server does not have.
