/**
 * Elasticsearch / OpenSearch Database Provider (issue #424, Phase 1)
 *
 * SQL over a search cluster's HTTP surface with no runtime dependency: every
 * statement, every schema read and every metric goes through the
 * `SearchTransport` seam, so this file names no endpoint, no envelope key, no
 * product fault name and no status code, and `seam-guard.test.ts` fails the build
 * if it starts to. The wire lives in `http-transport.ts`; the mapping-driven schema
 * lives in `introspect.ts`.
 *
 * ONE implementation serves TWO type-ids. Everything the two products disagree
 * about on the wire is a row in the transport's dialect table; everything they
 * disagree about HERE is a field of {@link SearchProduct}, and there is exactly one
 * such field (see `prepareQuery`). The two exported classes are therefore thin by
 * construction - a subclass that only names its product - which is the shape that
 * makes "a third fork is one more constant" true rather than aspirational.
 *
 * It extends `SQLBaseProvider` because the query language really is SQL on both
 * products (measured: `POST` the statement, get columns and positional rows back,
 * on a basic licence and on a stock OpenSearch node alike) and because the shared
 * limiter's `LIMIT n` is correct on both. ES|QL is deliberately unused: OpenSearch
 * has none at all, and a surface only one product has cannot be the shared query
 * language.
 *
 * Everything asserted below was measured on 2026-08-19 against Elasticsearch 9.1.4
 * (basic licence, security disabled) and OpenSearch 3.8.0 (security disabled), on
 * stock single nodes with one index of one document. The measurements that shaped
 * the code, in the order they cost the most design:
 *
 * 1. **`OFFSET` exists on one product only.** `SELECT customer FROM probe_orders
 *    LIMIT 2 OFFSET 1` is HTTP 200 on OpenSearch and HTTP 400 on Elasticsearch
 *    (`parsing_exception`, "line 1:43: mismatched input 'OFFSET' expecting <EOF>"),
 *    with or without an `ORDER BY` in front of it. The inherited limiter emits
 *    exactly that clause for any page after the first, so on Elasticsearch the
 *    editor's "load more" would turn a working statement into a syntax error.
 *    `prepareQuery` refuses to produce it - see the method for why it refuses
 *    LOUDLY rather than by leaving the statement alone.
 * 2. **Neither product's SQL writes.** `CREATE TABLE t (id BIGINT)` and
 *    `UPDATE probe_orders SET customer = 'x' WHERE id = 1` are both HTTP 400 on
 *    both: Elasticsearch answers `parsing_exception` ("mismatched input 'CREATE'
 *    expecting {'(', 'DEBUG', 'DESC', 'DESCRIBE', 'EXPLAIN', 'SELECT', 'SHOW',
 *    'SYS', 'WITH'}" - the grammar lists everything it accepts, and no mutation is
 *    among them) and OpenSearch answers `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException` ("Query
 *    must start with SELECT, DELETE, SHOW or DESCRIBE: ..."). So
 *    `supportsCreateTable` and `supportsInlineRowEdit` are false as a fact about
 *    the grammars, not as an unimplemented feature. Documents change through the
 *    document APIs, which this provider does not expose.
 * 3. **An index has no schema above it, and both products say so in SQL.**
 *    Elasticsearch's `SHOW TABLES` answers a `catalog` of `docker-cluster` (the
 *    cluster name) and OpenSearch's answers `TABLE_CAT` `docker-cluster` with
 *    `TABLE_SCHEM` **null**. The catalog is not addressable either - measured,
 *    `SELECT customer FROM "docker-cluster".probe_orders` is a
 *    `parsing_exception` - so the monitoring rows carry NO schema name rather than
 *    a namespace this provider made up. See {@link SEARCH_SCHEMA_NAME}.
 * 4. **Nothing on this surface returns a plan.** `supportsExplain` is false and no
 *    `explainFormat` is declared, so the UI hides the Explain button and tab and
 *    `src/lib/explain/` is untouched. (Elasticsearch does answer `EXPLAIN <select>`
 *    with its internal plan text, but OpenSearch's SQL plugin does not, and a tab
 *    that works on one of two products behind one code path is worse than no tab.)
 * 5. **The wire carries no timing and no cancellation.** Neither answer contains a
 *    duration, so `executionTime` is this process's measurement of the exchange -
 *    the only number in existence. And the seam's own header records that an abort
 *    closes the client's socket while the cluster keeps working, so the deadline
 *    below is a CLIENT deadline and nothing else; `cancelQuery` is deliberately not
 *    implemented, because a method named "cancel" that cancels nothing server-side
 *    is a promise this provider cannot keep.
 *
 * Positional parameters are refused rather than emulated. Both endpoints really do
 * bind them - measured, `{"query":"... WHERE id = ?","params":[1]}` on
 * Elasticsearch and `{"query":"... WHERE id = ?","parameters":[{"type":"integer",
 * "value":"1"}]}` on OpenSearch both answer HTTP 200 - but they spell the request
 * differently, the seam carries the statement alone, and inlining the values here
 * to work around that would be building a SQL-injection site inside a provider.
 * Refusing is the same call `clickhouse/index.ts` makes for the same reason (#264).

 *
 * ONE declaration for TWO type-ids, and that is a measured claim rather than a
 * convenience: every endpoint below answered the same shape on both products, and the
 * capability equality test in `tests/integration/db/opensearch-provider.test.ts`
 * fails if the two ever diverge. The ONE difference the two showed is not in this

 * pipelines and 61 index templates of its own while a stock OpenSearch node ships
 * none, so the empty-pipeline case (HTTP 404, see the transport) is the first-run state
 * on one product and takes a deletion to reach on the other.
 *
 * WHAT IS ABSENT, and why each absence is a fact rather than a gap:
 *
 * - NO view, function, procedure or trigger. Neither product's SQL surface has
 *   CREATE VIEW, and OpenSearch's grammar contains no CREATE statement of any kind
 *   (measured: `CREATE TABLE t (id BIGINT)` answers `SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`,
 *   "Query must start with SELECT, DELETE, SHOW or DESCRIBE"). Elasticsearch 9.4 adds
 *   an ES|QL views API as a TECHNICAL PREVIEW, and #789 Phase 2 ANSWERED that rather
 *   than deferring it again: a preview surface gets no folder, so there is no kind and
 *   nothing for the source read to read. It would also be a kind only ONE of the two
 *   products this file serves could hold. Both provider docs carry the same answer.
 * - NO stored script. Both products have them and NEITHER has a list-all API:
 *   `GET /_scripts` is refused outright on both ("Invalid index name [_scripts]"),
 *   only get-by-id exists. An object that cannot be enumerated cannot be a tree node,
 *   which is the same call Redis's EVAL scripts got.
 * - NO legacy index template. `_template` is a separate namespace whose names may
 *   COLLIDE with the composable ones (measured on both), so one kind fed by both
 *   endpoints would hold two different objects at one path.
 * - NO secondary-index kind, in the relational sense. Every mapped field is inverted
 *   -indexed as a property of being mapped, so there is nothing a user declared and
 *   nothing to name. `index` here is the engine's own word for what a table is.
 *
 * WHY AN ALIAS AND A DATA STREAM ARE RELATIONS and not config objects: both answer
 * rows through the SQL endpoint on both products (measured, `SELECT customer FROM
 * probe_orders_alias` and `SELECT * FROM probe_stream`), which is exactly what
 * `ObjectRole`'s "relation" means. Neither declares `acceptsRowWrites`: an alias may

 *   show is not a definition anybody could re-apply, and the round trip from that answer
 *   back to a `PUT` that recreates the index could not be established.
 * - `alias`: one alias over N indices has ONE DEFINITION PER INDEX and a different
 *   create shape (`POST /_aliases` with an actions array), while the tree deliberately
 *   deduplicates those N rows to one object. There is no single text belonging to the
 *   row that exists.
 * - `stream`: a data stream's definition IS the matching index template, which is a
 *   DIFFERENT OBJECT in a DIFFERENT FOLDER of the same tree. Showing it here would
 *   present another object's definition as this one's, which is exactly what the
 *   per-object reads below refuse to do for a wildcard name.
 *

 * total. The optional index size stays absent for the same reason - a zero would be

 *
 * The count is the cluster's own, and it counts more documents than a statement can
 * return: measured on OpenSearch, `probe_shapes` reports 2 documents while a count
 * over it answers 1, because its `items` field is `nested` and every nested element
 * is stored as a document of its own. So this number is the index's document count
 * as the cluster reports it, not the number of rows a `SELECT *` would produce, and
 * an index with nested fields will always read higher than its queries do. Deriving
 * it from SQL instead would be a statement per index, on a surface whose grammar the
 * tree must not depend on, to answer a different question than the panel asks.
 *
 * A CLOSED index reports neither a document count nor a size (measured: both arrive
 * as JSON null while the listing still names the index). `TableStats.rowCount`,
 * `totalSize` and `totalSizeBytes` are required numbers, so for those three a closed
 * index has nowhere to read but zero. `tableSize` and `tableSizeBytes` are OPTIONAL,
 * so they are OMITTED instead: a 0 there would be a fabricated measurement rather
 * than a forced one. The cost is deliberate and cluster-wide - `StorageTab` gates its
 * Data figure on `tables.every((t) => t.tableSizeBytes !== undefined)`, so ONE closed
 * index takes that figure to N/A for every open index beside it - and that is what the
 * optional field prescribes, because a partial sum reads as a measurement. The schema

   * refusal is read off the declaration and never off the kind id, so a kind this engine
   * does not declare at all takes the same path.
   *
   * ONE REQUEST, AND IT NAMES THE OBJECT. There is no listing read first: the endpoint
   * answers for a name directly, and reading the folder to prove the object exists would
   * double every Source tab's cost to answer a question the endpoint answers itself. The
   * kind decides which endpoint, so asking for a pipeline by the name of a template is
   * an absence rather than a template rendered as a pipeline.
   *
   * ABSENCE RAISES AND ONLY A CLUSTER'S ANSWER IS A REFUSAL, and the two are told apart
   * on the wire rather than by guessing. The seam answers null for "the cluster holds no
   * such object", which covers both spellings the two endpoints use for it (measured
   * 2026-09-13: `{}` from the pipeline endpoint and the full error envelope from the
   * template endpoint), and this raises a `QueryError` naming the object. A cluster that
   * ANSWERED and refused - a security plugin denying the endpoint, an engine fault, a
   * body this client could not read - becomes a refusal part carrying the cluster's own
   * sentence, unprefixed and unrewritten. ONE arm is the exception and both provider
   * docs say so: a DENIAL carries the transport's own composed sentence
   * ("Elasticsearch refused the credentials (HTTP 403)"), because security is disabled
   * on both compose services and a bogus `Basic` header is ignored there, so no 401 or
   * 403 body exists to carry through and the status is the only thing observed.
   * A transport failure is neither: nobody answered at all, so it RAISES,
   * because "connect ECONNREFUSED" printed in the Source pane as this object's own
   * refusal has no raise, nothing to retry and nothing distinguishing it from a real
   * denial. That distinction is {@link isClusterRefusal}.
   *
   * A REFUSAL IS PER ENDPOINT and not per cluster, which is the same measurement
   * `countObjects` rests on: these are separate endpoints and a security plugin grants
   * privileges per endpoint, so a pipeline read can be denied while a template read
   * answers. Neither refusal can be produced on the compose services - security is
   * disabled on both and a bogus `Basic` header is IGNORED (measured, HTTP 200 on both) -
   * and both provider docs say CANNOT rather than reporting around it.
   *
   * AN EMPTY DEFINITION CANNOT ARRIVE, which is why design guarantee 2's empty-text
   * refusal arm is absent here rather than forgotten. Measured on Elasticsearch 9.1.4
   * and OpenSearch 3.8.0 on 2026-09-13: `PUT /_ingest/pipeline/<id>` with `{}` is HTTP
   * 400 (`parse_exception`, "[processors] required property is missing") and
   * `PUT /_index_template/<name>` with `{}` is HTTP 400 (`illegal_argument_exception`,
   * "Required [index_patterns]"), so the smallest definition either endpoint will store
   * is `{"processors":[]}` or `{"index_patterns":[...]}`. The rendered text is a JSON
   * object with at least one member and can be neither empty nor whitespace-only.
   *
   * WHAT THE TEXT IS: `form: "complete"`, because the endpoint answers the whole
   * definition rather than a summary of it, and `origin: "rendered"`, because this
   * product prints it. The bytes the cluster sent are NOT what a reader sees, and both
   * provider docs record the three measured differences a JSON re-serialisation makes
   * (a long past 2^53 loses precision, integer-like keys are hoisted, an exponent is
   * re-spelled). Nothing is dropped, which is what keeps `complete` true.
   *
   * The object name is `path[path.length - 1]` and the container is every segment the
   * declaration assigns to a level, never `path[0]`: standing ruling 5g, pinned in both
   * suites by a two-level declaration swapped in through `spyOn` and driven to the URL
