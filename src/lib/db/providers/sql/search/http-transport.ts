/**
 * Elasticsearch / OpenSearch HTTP transport (issue #424, Phase 1)
 *
 * The only implementation of the `SearchTransport` seam, and the only file in the
 * provider allowed to know how either product encodes a request or an answer: the
 * endpoint paths, the query strings, the success-envelope keys
 * (`columns`/`rows` against `schema`/`datarows`/`total`/`size`), the two failure
 * envelopes and the engine fault names inside them, the `_cat` column names, the
 * mapping keys, and `fetch` itself. `seam-guard.test.ts` fails the build the moment
 * any of that vocabulary appears elsewhere in the directory, which is what keeps
 * "the official client library is one new file" true rather than aspirational.
 *
 * Zero runtime dependency: every call is one request through the runtime's own
 * `fetch`, and ONE class serves both products - everything they disagree about is
 * a row in {@link DIALECTS}. Two near-identical code paths would have made the
 * seam pointless, so the rule enforced below is that no method branches on
 * `this.dialect`; it reads `this.spec`.
 *
 * Everything asserted here was measured on 2026-08-19 against Elasticsearch 9.1.4
 * (basic licence, security disabled) and OpenSearch 3.8.0 (security disabled), on
 * a stock single node. The measurements that shaped the code, in the order they
 * cost the most design:
 *
 * 1. **Duplicate output names diverge.** `SELECT 1 AS c, 2 AS c, 3 AS c` answers
 *    HTTP 200 on Elasticsearch with THREE columns all named `c`
 *    (`{"columns":[{"name":"c",...},{"name":"c",...},{"name":"c",...}],"rows":[[1,2,3]]}`),
 *    and is REFUSED outright by OpenSearch - HTTP 400,
 *    `IllegalArgumentException`, "Multiple entries with same key: c=3 and c=2".
 *    So the seam's uniqueness invariant is load-bearing on exactly one of the two
 *    products, and `disambiguate` below is what upholds it; on OpenSearch it can
 *    never fire, which is a fact about that engine and not dead code.
 * 2. **Rows are positional on both** (`rows` / `datarows` are arrays of arrays), so
 *    a row is rebuilt against the declared column list rather than read as an
 *    object. That is also why the declared order is authoritative.
 * 3. **The status code misclassifies, in both directions.** A missing index is
 *    HTTP **400** on Elasticsearch (`verification_exception`, "line 1:15: Unknown
 *    index [nope_missing]") and HTTP **404** on OpenSearch
 *    (`IndexNotFoundException`) - so a status-driven classifier would call the same
 *    typo a bad request on one product and a missing endpoint on the other. In the
 *    other direction, `SELECT 1/0` is HTTP **500** on Elasticsearch
 *    (`arithmetic_exception`, "/ by zero") for what is a user's arithmetic. Both
 *    are the #264 ClickHouse lesson again: categorisation is body-driven.
 * 4. **A string-valued `error` means the request never reached the SQL engine.**
 *    Measured: `POST /_plugins/_sql` against Elasticsearch answers HTTP 400 with
 *    `{"error":"no handler found for uri [/_plugins/_sql] and method [POST]"}`, and
 *    `POST /_sql` against OpenSearch answers HTTP 405 with
 *    `{"error":"Incorrect HTTP method for uri [/_sql?format=json] ...","status":405}`.
 *    Both spell `error` as a STRING where a real engine failure spells it as an
 *    OBJECT, which makes the JSON type of one field a reliable "the SQL plugin is
 *    not installed / this is not that product" discriminator.
 * 5. **`_cat` numbers are strings, and `null` for a closed index.** Even with
 *    `bytes=b`, `docs.count` and `pri.store.size` arrive quoted ("5913"), and a
 *    closed index answers JSON `null` for every one of them while still reporting
 *    `"status":"close"`. Both are parsed here; a caller sees a number or an
 *    admission that there is none.
 * 6. **ES's own `DESCRIBE` is the specification for the flattening.** On an index
 *    whose mapping has an object and a multi-field, `DESCRIBE probe_shapes` answers
 *    exactly `address`/STRUCT, `address.city`/VARCHAR, `note`/VARCHAR,
 *    `note.keyword`/VARCHAR - containers included, dotted, in that shape - and
 *    `SELECT note.keyword, address.city` then works. `flattenProperties` reproduces
 *    that set from `_mapping`, which is why a multi-field is emitted as a child
 *    rather than merely flagged.
 *
 * On authentication: both probe clusters run with security DISABLED, and it was
 * measured that a bogus `Basic` header is IGNORED there (HTTP 200 on both), so no
 * 401/403 body could be captured. Rather than invent one, `auth` is decided on the
 * HTTP status alone - the one signal whose meaning is fixed by HTTP itself - and
 * no unmeasured fault name is listed in the tables below.

 * envelope (`index_not_found_exception`, "no such index [nope]"), while the empty set

 * (ruling 5f) while the badge is short by exactly the objects nobody can see. That is

   * The paging is NOT an optimisation, it is a correctness fix, and it exists
   * because an earlier version of this file asserted the opposite. Measured
   * 2026-08-19 on Elasticsearch 9.1.4: `SELECT k, COUNT(*) FROM probe_buckets
   * GROUP BY k` over an index holding 1500 distinct values answers HTTP 200 with
   * **1000 rows and a `cursor`** even though no `fetch_size` was ever requested -
   * an aggregation is paged by the engine's own default. Dropping that cursor
   * returned two thirds of the buckets and labelled the result complete, which is
   * worse than an error: a user reading a GROUP BY has no way to notice 500
   * missing groups. Following it retrieves exactly the remaining 500 and the
   * second page carries NO cursor, so the loop terminates on the engine's word.
   *
   * Two traps the loop has to respect, both measured on that same run:
   * - page two answers with rows and NO `columns` member at all, so the column
   *   declaration comes from page one and must be carried forward rather than
   *   re-read;
   * - `MAX_PAGES` bounds the loop because the terminating condition is the
   *   server's, and a seam must not offer an unbounded remote loop. Hitting it is
   *   reported rather than silently accepted - the failure mode being fixed here
   *   is precisely a truncation nobody was told about.
   *
   * On the abort the seam asks about: aborting closes the CLIENT's socket and
   * nothing else. No cancellation request is sent, because neither product's SQL
   * endpoint offers one for a RUNNING statement - measured, Elasticsearch's
   * `POST /_sql/close` exists (a bogus cursor answers HTTP 400 rather than "no
   * handler found") but it closes a paging cursor. So the cluster finishes the
   * query it was given after a cancellation, which is what the `cancelled` message
   * must not pretend otherwise about. A cursor this method is still holding when it
   * stops early is closed on the way out, because that one IS server-side state.
