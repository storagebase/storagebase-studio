/**
 * Search-engine transport seam (issue #424, Phase 1)
 *
 * One provider implementation serves TWO type-ids, `elasticsearch` and
 * `opensearch`, because the two products speak the same shape of SQL over HTTP
 * and differ only in wire detail. This interface is where that stops being a
 * claim: provider logic, introspection and monitoring go through it, so
 * everything the two disagree about is confined to `http-transport.ts`.
 *
 * What the two disagree about, all live-measured on 2026-08-19 against
 * Elasticsearch 9.1.4 (basic licence) and OpenSearch 3.8.0:
 *
 * - the SQL endpoint path: `POST /_sql?format=json` against `POST /_plugins/_sql`
 * - the success envelope: `{columns:[{name,type}], rows:[[...]]}` against
 *   `{schema:[{name,type}], datarows:[[...]], total, size, status}`
 * - the failure envelope AND the discriminator inside it. Elasticsearch answers
 *   `{error:{root_cause,type,reason,caused_by}}` and names the fault in
 *   `error.type` (`parsing_exception`, `verification_exception`); OpenSearch
 *   answers `{error:{reason,details,type}}` where `type` is a Java class name
 *   (`SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`) and the useful text is in `details`.
 * - ES|QL exists on Elasticsearch (`POST /_query`, and it works on a basic
 *   licence) and does not exist on OpenSearch at all (405). It is deliberately
 *   NOT used: a surface only one of the two products has cannot be the shared
 *   query language, and the SQL endpoint is available on both without a licence.
 *
 * The status code misclassifies in BOTH directions, which is why categorisation is
 * body-driven. Measured: a missing index is HTTP **400** on Elasticsearch
 * (`verification_exception`) and HTTP **404** on OpenSearch
 * (`IndexNotFoundException`) - the same typo, two statuses, neither of which means
 * what the code says. In the other direction `SELECT 1/0` is HTTP **500** on
 * Elasticsearch for what is a user's arithmetic. This is the same lesson ClickHouse
 * taught in #264, where a permission denial arrives as 500.
 *
 * (An earlier revision of this header asserted 400 on both products. That was
 * written from the first fixture pair and refuted by the implementation's own
 * measurement of OpenSearch. The conclusion did not change; the reason it holds
 * got stronger.)
 *
 * Apart from the error type this file is purely structural: no I/O, and no wire
 * vocabulary. `seam-guard.test.ts` fails the build when a path, an envelope key
 * or a product error type appears anywhere in this directory except
 * `http-transport.ts` - that guard is what keeps "adding a second implementation
 * is one new file" true rather than aspirational.
 */

/**
 * Which product a connection points at.
 *
 * This is the ONLY product distinction that crosses the seam. It is a type-id,
 * not a feature flag: provider logic may use it to phrase a message or pick a
 * label, and must never use it to decide behaviour - behaviour differences belong
 * in the transport, and capability differences belong in `getCapabilities()`.
 * CLAUDE.md forbids `=== 'mongodb'`-style branching outside provider classes for
 * exactly this reason.
