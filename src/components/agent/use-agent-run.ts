    Memoised on the entries alone, which is the whole of the fold's input. Without
    it the fold re-walked the entire accumulated ledger on every render of the rail
    rather than on every new event — a multiplier that cost nothing while a run was
    sixteen turns and is worth removing now that a drive may take sixty turns and
    spend forty-two statements — `data-analysis`, which is the largest row in
    `AGENT_WORKFLOW_BUDGETS` and the one to size this against. (It was written
    against `database-assessment`'s forty-eight and forty-five, which understated the
    ceiling by a quarter the moment the analysis row landed.) What it does not remove
    is the fold's O(n) work per
    new entry, which is O(n squared) over a run's life; that is measured as fine at
    these sizes and is not optimised on a list nobody has seen be slow.

    Derived rather than held: what makes a stored conversation INTERRUPTED is that nothing
    here is following one, and `runId` is that fact. Held in state it would need clearing
    from the start path, which is a second writer for something already knowable.

    A start writes the new conversation to the store, so the snapshot moves to it — and
    `runId` is what keeps that from being announced as interrupted the moment it begins.

    `runId` alone was not enough. `start()` clears it BEFORE it fetches, so for as long as
    the POST was in flight this read the previous conversation out of the store and the rail
    said it "ended when the page reloaded" — about the conversation the user was in the act
    of continuing, and with no page having reloaded. `isBusy` is the missing half: while a
    start is in flight a run IS being opened, so nothing is un-followed. It also restores
    what this property documents about itself, because `thread` keeps its previous value
    across that same window and the two would otherwise both name one conversation.
