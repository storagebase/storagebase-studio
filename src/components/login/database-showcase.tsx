/**
 * The login hero's engine list, on both surfaces.
 *
 * Every name, icon and accent colour comes from `DB_UI_CONFIG` through
 * `listShowcaseDatabases()`. Nothing here types an engine name: the defect issue #425
 * closes was two hand-written five-item arrays in `login-form.tsx` that stopped tracking
 * `DatabaseType` three providers ago, so adding a provider must be enough to publish it.
 *
 * The two variants need two different token families and this is one of the two easiest
 * places in the page to ship invisible text:
 * the desktop block sits inside the hero's left column, which is pinned dark by a nested
 * `dark` class and therefore re-declares fill/hairline/fg for that subtree only, while the
 * mobile block lives in the right panel and follows the viewer's theme through
 * muted/foreground. Swapping either set into the other surface renders the pills the same
 * colour as their background.
 *
 * `pointer-events-none select-none` matches the decorative feature cards above it: this is
 * showcase content on an unauthenticated page, not navigation.
 *
 * The desktop text sits at `fg-tertiary` rather than further down the ramp because the ramp
 * runs out of contrast before it runs out of steps on this ground: `fg-subtle` over
 * `surface` measures 2.6:1 and `fg-muted` over a `fill` pill 3.9:1, both under the 4.5:1
 * WCAG AA floor for 12px type. `fg-tertiary` is 7.7:1 and is already the hero's own body
 * colour, so the block reads as one family rather than as an exception.

              Label and marker share ONE span rather than sitting as two flex children. As
              flex children the gap between them was visual only - the item's text read
              "LibreDB(embedded)" with no separator at all, which is what a screen reader and
              a copy-paste get. Inside one span the space is a real text node.

              No colour class on the marker: it inherits the item's own `fg-tertiary`.
              Stepping it down the ramp is what the eye wants and what the ramp cannot give
              on this ground - the measurements in this file's header put `fg-muted` at 3.9:1
              and `fg-subtle` at 2.6:1, both under the 4.5:1 AA floor for type this small.
              The parentheses carry the demotion instead.
