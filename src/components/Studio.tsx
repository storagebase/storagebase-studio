   * What every statement entry point OUTSIDE the editor pane is handed while a Source tab is
   * active (#789 Phase 2, round 1 finding 1, completed in round 2).
   *
   * The pane below branches around the toolbar AND the editor together, so a Source tab draws
   * no Run button. That covers the desktop editor and NOTHING else, and the population is
   * larger than it looks, because "outside the editor pane" includes two surfaces that are
   * rendered outside the branch rather than merely mounted elsewhere. Every one of these
   * addresses `currentTab` and every one was live over a Source tab. The list is exhaustive as
   * of round 2, taken by reading each `updateCurrentTab` and each execute call in this file
   * rather than from the five the first round happened to name:
   *
   * - the command palette's "Run Query", and its saved-query and history loaders;
   * - the mobile header's RUN and its EXPLAIN, which is the same execution by another name;
   * - the BOTTOM PANEL's `onLoadQuery`. `BottomPanel` is rendered below the editor pane and
   *   outside its branch, and `BottomPanel.tsx` wires that one prop to both `QueryHistory`'s
   *   and `SavedQueries`' `onSelectQuery`. That makes it the plainest desktop gesture in the
   *   class: open a Source tab, open History in the bottom panel, click a past query.
   * - the AGENT RAIL's `onApplyStatement` and its `onRunStatement`. The second is the only
   *   entry point here that both WRITES and EXECUTES, so over a Source tab it ran a statement
   *   while the pane showed a read-only definition and nothing on screen said what ran.
   *
   * MEASURED before this existed: `updateCurrentTab({ query })` leaves a Source tab a Source
   * tab, so a statement loaded from the palette landed on a tab whose pane shows a read-only
   * definition and displays no query at all, and Run then executed it. With nothing loaded the
   * same Run executed the empty string, because `use-query-execution` has no empty-query guard
   * and `queryEditorRef.current` is null while `QueryEditor` is unmounted. The write is not
   * transient either: `use-tab-manager`'s SAVE effect persists `query` per tab, so the
   * statement outlived the session on a tab that never showed it.
   *
   * What this predicate deliberately does NOT gate, so the next reader does not reopen it. The
   * class is an entry point that addresses the ACTIVE TAB'S STATEMENT: it reads the tab's query
   * to run it, or writes a statement into the tab. Three groups fall outside that and each stays
   * live over a Source tab on purpose:
   *
   * - `CreateTableModal`, `DataImportModal` and `TestDataGenerator` call `executeQuery(sql)` with
   *   THEIR OWN statement, aimed at an object the reader picked in the tree, and the tab is only
   *   where the answer lands. `executeQuery` with an override never writes `query`, so nothing is
   *   put on the tab, and `BottomPanel` draws the result below the definition. Gating these would
   *   take away a working action because an unrelated tab happens to be open.
   * - `QuerySafetyDialog`'s Proceed and the unlimited-rows dialog's Load All continue an execution
   *   that is already under way, so they are reachable only through something already allowed.
   * - the mobile header's `onClearQuery` writes the EMPTY string, which is the value a Source tab
   *   already holds: `openSourceTab` appends with `query: ""` and, with the entry points above
   *   closed, nothing can put a statement there. A gate here would be a line no mutation could
   *   kill, and on a workspace persisted by an older build it would preserve the stale statement
   *   this predicate exists to keep out.
   *
   * A no-op rather than an absent control, because every component that draws these takes them
   * as REQUIRED props and none of those files is this task's to change. That is the smaller
   * half of the answer: the item should not be drawn at all, on the same argument the pane
   * already makes, and hiding it is filed for the shells that own those files (#789). What is
   * closed here is the half that matters, which is that nothing runs and nothing is written
   * onto a tab that cannot show it.

  /**
   * What this shell does after an apply that CHANGED the addressed object (#789 Phase 3).
   *
   * MEASURED, and it is the reason this handler exists at all: the Source pane NEVER re-reads
   * after a change made elsewhere in the same app. A new body was applied to
   * `p3probe.order_total` through `POST /api/db/query` while its Source tab was open, and the tab
   * kept showing the pre-apply text with no stale banner. `objectRefreshToken` above is a counter
   * this shell increments for what IT ran, and a raw query is not one of them, so an apply that
   * did not move it would leave the reader looking at the definition they just replaced.
   *
   * TWO WRITES IN ONE HANDLER, and the batching is the point rather than an optimisation. React
   * commits both together, so the pane re-renders exactly once, with `refreshToken = n+1` AND
   * `document === undefined`. Its read effect then issues a fresh read recording `tokenAtRead =
   * n+1`, and the landed read writes `readAtToken = n+1`, which EQUALS the counter. So the tab
   * that applied is NOT marked stale, while every other open Source tab is: the tab that applied
   * knows exactly what happened, and the others know only that something did. Split into two
   * commits, with the clear first, the read goes out at token n and comes back stale on the one
   * tab whose reader is certain about what changed.
   *
   * The CLEAR is `onSourceChange`'s explicit-undefined form, which is a clear and not a no-op,
   * and it addresses the ACTIVE tab. It reaches the right tab, and the reason written here first
   * was NOT the reason, which is worth the space because the wrong reason survives a refactor the
   * right one would not.
   *
   * The wrong reason: "the pane that performed the apply is mounted in the active tab, because it
   * is the only Source pane this shell renders". MEASURED FALSE at the moment that matters. With
   * the apply in flight and a direct DOM click moving the strip to another tab, the apply landed,
   * the toast fired, and the tab that was active THEN was not cleared.
   *
   * The real reason is a STALE CLOSURE, and it is load-bearing rather than incidental:
   * `onSourceChange` here is bound to the `activeTabId` of the render at CONFIRM time, and the
   * pane captures it through `onApplied`, so the clear addresses the tab that was active when the
   * reader pressed Confirm. That is the tab that applied, which is what this is for.
   *
   * Reachability of the disagreement, MEASURED AGAIN AND THE OTHER WAY (D82). An earlier reading
   * here said the strip cannot be moved while the dialog is open, because Radix's modal aria-hides
   * it, and that `setActiveTabId` has no caller outside the strip and the sidebar tree. Both halves
   * were wrong. Aria-hidden is not removed: the strip stays in the tree, and `StudioTabBar`
   * registers the new-tab shortcut on `document` on purpose, so it works while Monaco owns focus
   * (#745), and a keydown from a control INSIDE the dialog reaches that listener. `addTab` ends
   * with `setActiveTabId(newId)`, so `setActiveTabId` does have a caller the modal does not cover,
   * and `handleTableClick` is a SECOND one, reachable in the same window through the palette's own
   * document listener. Both are named where they are refused, in `refuseWhileApplying` below.
   *
   * What follows from that is worse than a mis-addressed clear and is answered in `handleAddTab`
   * below: the new Query tab unmounts the Source pane, and the dialog with it, mid apply. The
   * stale closure above is still the reason the clear reaches the right tab; it is now the reason
   * on a path where the two readings CAN disagree, rather than one where nothing could tell.
   *
   * The DRAFT is not dropped here. The pane drops it itself, keyed on the part its PLAN was built
   * for, which is a key this shell does not hold and must not guess.

   * dialog refuses every exit IT owns: while `applying` it withholds its close button and prevents
   * Escape, a press outside and every other interaction outside. What it cannot refuse is a global
   * listener, and `grep -rE 'addEventListener\(\s*"keydown' src` answers SIX, of which TWO can
   * move the active tab here:
   *
   * - `src/components/studio/StudioTabBar.tsx`, on `document`: the new-tab shortcut (#745).
   * - `src/components/CommandPalette.tsx`, on `document`: Cmd/Ctrl+K, whose table rows reach
   *   `handleTableClick`. Both fire from a control inside the modal, and both are refused below.
   * - `src/components/DataProfiler.tsx`, on `document`, and MOUNTED BY THIS SHELL. It is bound only
   *   while the profiler is open, it answers Escape alone, and all it does is call the profiler's
   *   own `onClose`. It moves no tab. An earlier form of this paragraph said there were two
   *   listeners and missed it, which is the unmeasured-absence mistake D82 was filed over, so it is
   *   named here rather than left out for being harmless.
   * - `src/components/CodeGenerator.tsx`, on `document`, and MOUNTED BY THIS SHELL. It is bound only
   *   while the generator is open, answers an unhandled Escape alone, closes only that modal and
   *   moves no tab (#879).
   * - `src/components/ShortcutsDialog.tsx`, on `document` (#746), and MOUNTED BY THIS SHELL. It
   *   answers `?` alone (guarded against the editor and every text input), opens a dialog that
   *   reads shortcut labels and closes itself, and moves no tab.
   * - `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`, on `window`, toggling a sidebar. An unused shadcn primitive
   *   with no importer anywhere in `src` (P5), so it is mounted nowhere.
   *
   * The palette door was measured item by item, with the real palette rendered over a held apply:
   * Cmd/Ctrl+K opens it, focus moves into its input, and of the ten entries it offered exactly one
   * moved the active tab. Run Query, Format Query, Save Current Query, New Connection, the ERD and
   * the connection row all left the dialog standing and the conflict still rendered. A TABLE row
   * calls this shell's `onTableClick` -> `handleTableClick`, which ends with `setActiveTabId(newId)`
   * exactly as `addTab` does, and that unmounted the pane and lost the answer. Health Dashboard,
   * Monitoring and Logout were not measurable here: they call `router.push` and `handleLogout`, and
   * the router is a double in the harness. They leave the page rather than reshuffle it, which is
   * an act with its own confirmation and is not this guard's to intercept.
   *
   * So the guard is bound to the two handlers that OPEN AND ACTIVATE A TAB, and the message is one
   * string for both: a gesture and its keyboard twin refusing on different words is the drift this
   * helper exists to prevent.
   *
   * REFUSED IS NOT SWALLOWED, which is the cost of this shape and is paid rather than accepted.
   * A keystroke that does nothing and says nothing reads as a broken shortcut, so the refusal
   * toasts, and it says what the reader is waiting for and what to do. Deferring the tab until the
   * answer lands was considered and rejected: a tab that opens by itself some seconds later is a
   * gesture the reader no longer connects to anything they did.
   *
   * "Once you have READ the answer" and not "once it is on screen", which the first wording said.
   * The refusal ends the moment `applying` ends, which is the moment the conflict, the refusal or
   * the failure renders, so a reader who takes the earlier wording literally opens the tab, unmounts
   * the pane and throws the answer away. Nothing was applied in that case and the copy in the
   * conflict says so, but advice that discards what the reader was waiting for is not advice.

   * WHY REFUSE THE KEYSTROKE RATHER THAN KEEP THE PANE MOUNTED, chosen and not defaulted into.

   * change: the shell renders one pane, `onSourceChange` addresses `activeTabId`, and a second
   * mounted pane would need its own per-tab patch channel and a second live read, while the dialog
   * it kept alive would be drawn over a Query tab the reader had just asked for. That is a wider
   * seam than the defect. Refusing is the smaller change and it matches what the dialog ALREADY
   * does with every exit it owns, and `refuseWhileApplying` above enumerates what it does not.
   *
   * The `+` button takes the same handler. It is covered by the modal and cannot be pressed in this
   * window, so the guard is unreachable through it, but one gesture and its keyboard twin refusing

    What the two standalone AI entry points do now (#331 T3). The in-editor chat is
    gone; the command palette's item and the mobile header's button open the RAIL on
    the statement the editor is holding. Both go through this one handler, because a
    decision made at each caller is a decision made twice.

    The workflow is INVESTIGATION, not query-optimization, and that is deliberate.
    The control being replaced was a general assistant, not an optimizer, so choosing
    the optimizer would commit the user to a goal they never asked for: that
    workflow's verifier requires the run to PROPOSE a change and back it with a plan
    it read — a comparison, or an index citing the plan it diagnosed
    (`src/lib/agent/goal-verifier.ts`) — and a run that perfectly explained what the
    statement does proposes nothing, so it would still be recorded as "did not
    answer". The workflow control is one click away in the rail, and investigation is
    the general one.

    The objective is the statement and nothing composed around it. Writing prose like
    "why is this slow?" on the user's behalf would put words in a box that is theirs
    and stays editable. It is read from the tab this shell already owns rather than
    from the editor handle: `QueryEditor`'s `onContentChange` writes every keystroke
    into that tab through `updateTabById` (see the mount below), and `use-tab-manager`
    derives `currentTab` from the tabs it writes to — so the tab is current, and
    `getEditorValue` was the AI hook's private callback rather than a second source of
    truth. The seam bounds the length; nothing here has to.

    An empty editor mints no ask. An objective saying nothing would still be recorded
    as APPLIED by the rail, so it would clear a standing offer and overwrite nothing
    to no purpose. The entry point still opens the rail — which below `md` means
    opening the sheet here, since the seam only opens it when it has an ask to apply,
    and above `md` means nothing at all: the rail is already the panel, and arming the
    sheet flag there would pop a sheet open the first time the window narrows.
  */
  /*
    The statement is passed as the user wrote it, minus the whitespace around it. That
    trim is not a liberty taken with their text: the rail sends `objective.trim()` when
    Start is pressed, so anything this kept would be dropped a moment later anyway, and
    keeping it would only spend the seam's length budget on blanks. What is deliberately
    NOT done is composing anything around the statement — no "Why is this query slow?"

          The agent rail. Absent — not hidden, not disabled — while the server says
          the runtime is off, which is the default. One instance serves both
          presentations: this panel above `md`, and a sheet below it, where the panel
          is display:none and the mobile nav is what opens the rail.

          The imports above are static, so with the flag off the rail's modules and the
          two hydration modules beside them are still in the standalone bundle — as is
          `execution-policy.ts`,
          which the rail and the timeline import as VALUES for the budget meter's
          ceilings. What does NOT reach a browser is any agent RUNTIME module (the
          ledger, the run service, the tool layer, the model adapter — those are
          server-only and the rail imports nothing from them but types), and no agent
          request is made beyond the discovery probe. `docs/AGENT.md` states the same
          boundary for a reader who never opens this file.
          This repository lazy-imports libraries but no COMPONENT
          (neither `next/dynamic` nor `React.lazy` appears under `src/`), and the
          package boundary — the one that matters for what ships to platform — is
          pinned separately in T12.
