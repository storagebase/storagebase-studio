/**
 * The permanent way to the repository, sitting in the studio chrome beside the
 * version string. A static icon and a static href: nothing here reads a star
 * count or touches the network, so air-gapped installs and the CSP are unaffected.
 *
 * The octocat mark is inlined rather than imported because lucide-react 1.x
 * dropped every brand icon; inlining it (the convention already used by
 * `src/components/icons/db-icons.tsx`) keeps the dependency count unchanged. It
 * is a filled mark, so it paints with `fill="currentColor"` - no stroke - and it
 * carries `aria-hidden` explicitly, which lucide used to add on its behalf.
 *
 * That makes it optically heavier than the 1.5-stroke outline icons it sits
 * beside in the header, and that is accepted rather than corrected: checked at
 * its real 14px in both chrome surfaces, the octocat silhouette still reads, and
 * dimming it back to hairline weight would quietly demote the one permanent link
 * to the repository. The official mark is filled by definition.
 *
 * Following it also marks the one-shot star prompt handled - someone who has
 * already been to the repository should not be asked again by the tenth-query
 * toast. `dismissStarPrompt` is SSR-safe and swallows every storage failure, so
 * this handler cannot throw or block the navigation.
