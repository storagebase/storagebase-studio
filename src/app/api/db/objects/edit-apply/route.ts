/**
 * `POST /api/db/objects/edit-apply`: the half that WRITES (#789 Phase 3, discussion #778).
 *
 * IT TAKES THE PLAN AND NEVER THE TEXT AGAIN, which is ruling 1a in the letter: the bytes the user
 * approved in the preview are `plan.unit`, and `plan.unit` is what the engine receives. The seal
 * (`planToken`) is what makes that binding unforgeable while leaving the plan READABLE, which is
 * adjudication 2d: "opaque" means sealed, not unreadable.
 *
 * THIS IS THE FIRST RECORD OF A USER'S WRITE ANYWHERE IN THIS PRODUCT, and ruling 1c is why it is a
 * new `AuditEventType` arm rather than a reused `query_execution`: MEASURED, three DDL statements
 * through `POST /api/db/query` added ZERO events to the ring while one VACUUM on the same
 * connection in the same minute added exactly one.
 *
 * THE TWO EVENTS AND WHY THEY ARE TWO. The DECISION event is emitted BEFORE the provider is called
 * and is NOT wrapped in a try/catch, so any audit-sink failure propagates and the apply never
 * happens: the path fails closed on an unauditable write rather than performing it silently. That
 * is `src/lib/db/operations/execution.ts:11-20`'s rule for the agent path, applied here for the
 * same reason. The OUTCOME event is emitted after and IS wrapped, which is
 * `src/app/api/db/maintenance/route.ts:108-131`'s rule and its stated reason: the engine has
 * already acted, and a broken sink must never turn a completed apply into a 500 that invites a
 * retry that would be a SECOND DDL.
 *
 * WHAT AN EVENT MAY NEVER CARRY: the statement, the command payload, the reader's text, the
 * pre-image, the engine's message, the engine's code, the revision token, the plan token, or any
 * other part of the plan. `src/lib/audit.ts:456-461` forbids SQL text, request bodies and raw
 * `Error.message` by name, `AuditReason` is closed precisely so no path can put a driver string
 * into a record, and `MAX_AUDIT_FIELD_LENGTH` is 254, so an unvalidated string would be TRUNCATED
 * rather than refused. What the two events carry instead is the object address, the kind, the part,
 * the resolved strategy and one correlation id, which is `plan.planId`.
 *
 * `target` IS `plan.path.join("/")`, which is design 5.5's own spelling and is used here unchanged,
 * with its limit named rather than discovered: it is a FOURTH spelling of a path key in a
 * repository whose `pathKey` docblock says by name that a slash collides, so `["a/b"]` and
 * `["a","b"]` produce the same audit target. It is inherited rather than introduced, the audit
 * target is a human-readable label and never a lookup key, and changing it here would put the
 * audit's spelling out of step with the design.
 *
 * NO ADMIN GATE, and the ruling is MEASURED rather than preferred: it is recorded in full on
 * `edit-plan/route.ts` beside the same decision, with the limit that the measurement covers SQL
 * engines and Redis was not probed. This route inherits the seed role filter for free by going
 * through `resolveConnection` and adds no role test of its own.
 *
 * ONCE `applyObjectEdit` HAS BEEN CALLED, NO ERROR ESCAPES AS AN HTTP ERROR. Every throw becomes
 * `{ outcome: "interrupted", committed: "unknown" }` at 200, and so does an answer the outcome
 * predicate cannot read. That one rule closes three measured defects at once: a deliberate engine
 * refusal can never be a 500, a timeout can never answer `retryable: true`, and a provider that
 * forgets to classify one of its engine's errors degrades to "the disposition is unknown" rather
 * than to a false success. There is NO `retryable` on this route at any status: a client that
 * retries an apply whose disposition is unknown applies twice.

 *
 * THE TWO FALLBACKS ARE NOT THE SAME KIND OF THING, and the difference is measured rather than
 * assumed. `connectionName`'s two arms both have a live population: `resolveConnection` returns an
 * INLINE caller-supplied connection object verbatim, so a connection whose `name` is empty is the
 * caller's to send, and both the database arm and the `"unknown"` arm are driven by
 * `tests/api/db/objects/edit-apply.test.ts`. `user`'s arm has NONE: `guardRoute` keys the rate
 * limiter on `session.username` before this handler runs, and a session without one dies at
 * `truncatedKey` in `src/lib/api/rate-limit.ts` with
 * `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'key.slice')`, which is what a draft of that
 * test MEASURED. `SessionPayload.username` is a required `string`, so the fallback here is an
 * obligation of `ObjectRouteContext`'s looser `username?: string` and nothing more; it is kept
 * because the type requires it and because `src/app/api/db/maintenance/route.ts` spells the same
 * expression the same way.
