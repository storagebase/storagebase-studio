/**
 * `POST /api/db/objects/edit-plan`: the BUILD half of the object edit path (#789 Phase 3,
 * discussion #778).
 *
 * It takes the reader's edited text for ONE part and answers what an apply WOULD send: a plan
 * pinning the exact bytes, the definition the build read, and a token sealing the two together.
 * It executes nothing, it writes nothing, and it EMITS NO AUDIT EVENT: it is a read, every other
 * read in this product is unaudited, and auditing one read of nine would be a signal an operator
 * would misread. The apply route is where this product's first record of a user's write lives.
 *
 * TWO ROUTES RATHER THAN ONE WITH A `phase` FIELD, so the audit's two events are a property of
 * WHICH HANDLER RAN rather than of a runtime branch, and so `edit-apply/route.ts` can be read on
 * its own to see everything it does.
 *
 * A FLAT SIBLING OF THE OTHER EIGHT and never `objects/edit/plan`. The census in
 * `tests/api/db-objects.test.ts` enumerates DIRECT children of `src/app/api/db/objects/` that hold
 * a `route.ts`, so a nested pair would leave `edit/` with no `route.ts`, the census would filter it
 * out, and two new provider-reaching routes would be uncensused and unasserted for the 401 path
 * while the census kept passing.
 *
 * NO ADMIN GATE, and the ruling is MEASURED rather than preferred. Measured end to end with three
 * controls: a `user`-role session created and dropped a function through `POST /api/db/query`, both
 * with an inline caller-supplied connection carrying superuser credentials and with a managed seed
 * connection whose roles admit `*`, while the same cookie was refused 403 at
 * `POST /api/db/maintenance` and a seed scoped to `admin` refused it 403. So the role decides WHICH
 * connection may be opened and nothing about what may be done with it, and an admin gate here would
 * remove no capability while teaching an operator that Studio restricts DDL. This route inherits
 * the seed role filter FOR FREE by going through `resolveConnection`, and it adds no role test of
 * its own. `POST /api/db/maintenance` stays the only admin-gated route that reaches a user's
 * database. THE LIMIT IS RECORDED WITH THE RULING: that measurement covers SQL engines, which is
 * two of the three day-one engines, and Redis was NOT probed, so for Redis the ruling is inherited
 * rather than measured and the plan token is doing real work there.
 *
 * `readBoundedJson` rather than the handler's default body read, because the default answers
 * `{ error: "Empty request body" }` at 400 for a body the framework TRUNCATED at 10,485,760 bytes.
 * A caller reading that sentence has no way to learn that the fix is to send less.
