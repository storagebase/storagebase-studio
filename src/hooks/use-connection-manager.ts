  /*
    One read of the object surface, and it is the only catalog reading this hook does (#789).

    It was three requests until the flat schema reading was deleted: `/api/db/schema/list` for
    names and columns, `/api/db/objects/inventory` for the kind and the address, and
    `/api/db/schema/relations` for foreign keys and indexes, with a join on the display NAME
    holding the first two together. That join is gone with the reading it existed for, and so is
    every defect it carried: a name containing a dot lost its columns, a bare `orders` answered to
    every `orders` on the server, and an object the flat read never named could not be tagged at
    all.

    `/api/db/provider-meta` still comes first, and it is the cheapest read in the app: it
    constructs the provider and reads its capabilities WITHOUT opening a connection, so the extra
    request costs no socket, no pool client and no catalog statement. Its answer decides which
    kinds are asked for.

    ONLY THE RELATION KINDS ARE ASKED FOR. Measured against dvdrental on PostgreSQL 18 while the
    join still existed: 7 listings returning 59 objects for every kind against 3 listings
    returning 22 for the relation kinds, per container, on every connection select and every
    DDL-triggered refresh (`use-query-execution.ts`). The consumers of this list draw rows,
    columns and foreign keys, which is what `role: "relation"` declares; a routine or a trigger in
    it would be a row the diagram and the import target cannot use. The kinds come from the
    provider`s own declaration and never from a list written here.

    Unguarded on purpose: `fetchSchema` below is the guarded entry point every caller uses, and
    `loadObjects` is the one call that is allowed past the guard.
