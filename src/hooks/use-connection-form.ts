/**
 * Whether this editor OWNS a connection field or merely carries it.
 *
 * `buildConnection` rebuilds the whole connection from form state, so every field
 * without an input here used to disappear on save — silently, because a rebuilt
 * object looks complete. Three of them had consequences nobody would connect to a
 * rename: `seedId`/`managed` are a seed copy's provenance, and losing them made the
 * connection stop matching its seed, so the next load re-created the seed copy over
 * the top and discarded the edit entirely; `agentUser`/`agentPassword` are the
 * least-privilege execution profile (#328), so losing them downgrades an agent run to
 * the connection's main credentials without saying so.
 *
 * A `Record<keyof DatabaseConnection, ...>` rather than a list of names to copy, for
 * the reason `connection-secrets.ts` gives about credentials: the failure mode of a
 * list is silence, and silence is exactly how this bug survived. A field added to
 * `DatabaseConnection`, `SSLConfig` or `SSHTunnelConfig` now fails `bun run typecheck`
 * until someone decides whether the editor owns it.
 *
 * `edited` is not "always written" — the form omits a value it has none for, which is
 * how turning TLS or the tunnel off actually clears them. It means the FORM decides.
 * `conditional` is preserved only while the related form setting remains unchanged.

        refused, in its own words, and saves nothing; only a second one saves. The
