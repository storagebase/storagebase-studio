# Contributing to LibreDB Studio

First off, thank you for considering contributing to LibreDB Studio! It's people like you that make LibreDB Studio such a great tool.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Language

**Open an issue or a pull request in Chinese (中文) or Japanese (日本語) if that is easier for you.** You do not need fluent English to report a bug or propose a change, and a report we have to translate is far better than one you did not send. Maintainers will usually reply in English; say so if that does not work for you.

This applies to the conversation, not to the repository. Everything that lands in the tree stays in English: code, comments, commit messages, documentation and the pull request title.

If you are updating a translated README, note that `bun run readme:check` enforces that its engine table and install commands match [README.md](README.md). Translations may cover fewer install channels, but a command must never be paraphrased - a reader copy-pastes it.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates. When you create a bug report, include as many details as possible:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**
- **Describe the exact steps to reproduce the problem**
- **Describe the behavior you observed and what you expected**
- **Include screenshots if possible**
- **Include your environment details** (OS, browser, Node.js version)

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome! Please provide:

- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **A detailed description of the proposed feature**
- **Explain why this feature would be useful**
- **Include mockups or examples if applicable**

### Pull Requests

1. **Start from an issue.** Open one or comment on an existing one before you write code, and
   reference it from the PR (`Closes #123`). A PR with no linked issue is hard to review and, during
   Hacktoberfest, does not count.
2. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
3. **Write the failing test first, then the fix.** Every change that adds or alters executable
   lines lands with its tests in the same PR. The CI gate is 100% line coverage
   (`scripts/check-coverage.mjs` fails the required `Unit & Integration Tests` job below it), so a
   PR without tests cannot merge no matter how small the change.
4. **Run the checks locally when your environment supports them.** They mirror the required CI checks:

   ```bash
   bun run format && bun run lint && bun run typecheck && bun run knip \
     && bun run readme:check && bun run chart:check && bun run channels:showcase:check \
     && bun run security:check && bun run test && bun run build
   ```

   **CI is the merge gate.** If you cannot run a command locally, list that command and the reason
   under a `Testing` heading in your PR body; submit the PR, and a maintainer will approve the fork's
   workflow run so CI can verify it. You do not need to withdraw correct work because a local tool
   is unavailable.

   If your sandbox can reach the npm registry, `npm install -g bun` is another way to install Bun.
   Helm is only needed to run the chart tests: without it `bun run test` leaves those files out and names them, and CI runs them.
   The [devcontainer setup](#devcontainer--codespaces) below provides both tools.

   Always `bun run test`, never bare `bun test` over a directory: the runner gives each test file its
   own bun process, and `bun test tests/api` puts them all in one, where one file's `mock.module()`
   becomes every file's. To run a single file, name it: `bun tests/run-tests.ts tests/unit/x.test.ts`.
   `bun run test:coverage && bun run coverage:check` prints the exact uncovered `file:line` ranges.
   `bun tests/run-tests.ts --jobs=N` lowers the concurrency, which by default is one job per available CPU: that follows CPU affinity and a cgroup CPU limit, but no memory limit, and a job peaks at roughly 60 to 340 MiB.
   Use it in a memory-limited container that has no CPU limit, and when a file comes back as killed by SIGKILL from outside the runner, which on Linux is usually the OOM killer.
   A flag meant for `bun test` goes past a `--` the runner can see, which means invoking the runner directly with a selector first: `bun tests/run-tests.ts tests/unit -- --bail`.
   `bun run test -- --bail` does not work, because `bun run` removes the first `--` before the script sees it, and bun removes one that sits straight after the script path too.
5. **Keep the provider triad in lockstep.** Anything under `src/lib/db/providers/**` has a matching
   `docs/providers/<type-id>.md` and `tests/integration/db/<type-id>-provider.test.ts`; a change to
   one moves the other two in the same PR.
6. **The README is guarded.** `README.md` must keep its engine table, its install table and the
   plain-HTTP login warning under the quick start; `bun run readme:check` enforces it. This fork
   ships no translated READMEs.
7. **Follow the coding style**, write clear commit messages, and update documentation with the code.

### Keeping your branch current

Set up the upstream remote once after cloning your fork:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio.git
git remote -v
```

Refresh your feature branch before asking for review:

```bash
git status                      # commit or stash first; rebase refuses to run dirty
git fetch upstream              # in a direct clone: git fetch origin
git rebase upstream/main        # in a direct clone: git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease     # never plain --force
```

Rebase before review for three reasons that are specific to this repository.
Required status checks are not strict, so a green run can be against a `main` that has already moved and GitHub will not force the branch to update.
The [Security Scanning](#security-scanning) secret check scans the commits your branch adds, so deleting a credential in a later commit does not clear the finding; rewrite the commit that introduced it instead.
A stale branch that edits a shared file can merge cleanly while restoring an older version of someone else's work, and rebasing surfaces that drift before review.

`--force-with-lease` refuses the push when the remote branch has moved since your last fetch, which is the case where plain `--force` could delete someone else's commit.

If rebase reports conflicts, resolve each file, then continue:

```bash
git add <file>
git rebase --continue
```

Use `git rebase --abort` to return to where you started.

Do not rebase after a maintainer has started reviewing unless they ask you to.
Force-pushing replaces commit SHAs and loses the review's line anchors, so prefer new commits during review and rebase once at the end when asked.

After a rebase, run the complete local gate from the **Run the checks locally** step again.
The whole branch is re-verified from scratch, so do not rely on results from before the history rewrite.

### Contributor programs

The issues we have vetted for outside pickup are labeled
[`good first issue`](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
(small) and
[`help wanted`](https://github.com/libredb/libredb-studio/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
(medium). Each states what is wrong, where to look and what "done" looks like, and none needs a live
database cluster or a cloud account. That list is the one to pick from during Hacktoberfest, Social
Winter of Code, GSSoC or any other contributor program. Entries in `docs/BACKLOG.md` that carry no
label have not been vetted for outside pickup; ask in an issue first if one interests you.

- **Claim before you start.** Comment on the issue so two people do not build the same fix. A
  claimed issue with no activity for two weeks is open again.
- **A claim is a courtesy, not a lock.** It cannot reach somebody who already had the issue open,
  because GitHub sends no notification for a comment on a page you are already reading. So two
  people do occasionally arrive at the same issue, and when that happens neither of them did
  anything wrong. We decide by the clock rather than by the claim: work that was already in flight
  when the claim was posted is not queue-jumping, and a pull request that is already delivered is
  reviewed on its merits. Nobody is asked to write the same change twice, so whoever does not land
  it is offered the nearest open issue instead, and a review on the other pull request is credited
  here the same as code.
- **What counts.** A PR that references its issue, includes tests and passes the gate above. During
  October we also add `hacktoberfest-accepted` to merged PRs from the labeled list, for participants
  whose program still looks for it.
- **What does not count.** PRs that only reformat, rename, fix a typo without an issue, add a
  trailing comment or bump a version are closed with the `spam` or `invalid` label. Machine-generated
  PRs that do not run the tests fall in the same bin.
- **Maintainers:** the block pasted at the foot of a curated issue lives in
  [`.github/curated-issue-footer.md`](.github/curated-issue-footer.md). Copy it from there rather
  than retyping it; `tests/unit/curated-issue-footer.test.ts` holds its CI-gate paragraph to the
  copy in step 4 above.

The repository keeps the `hacktoberfest` topic for discoverability. Note that Hacktoberfest 2026
itself is organised around in-person and online events and no longer counts pull requests; the
labels above are how this repository welcomes contributors in any month.

### The contributor ladder

Every change here lands with its tests in the same pull request, under a hard 100% line-coverage
gate and six required checks. Clearing that bar says something about you, so we write down who
cleared it and what it earns.

**There is no threshold on this page, and that is deliberate.** We do not count merged pull
requests, changed lines, closed issues or anything else. A count measures how often somebody showed
up; it cannot see the care they took, the bug nobody else found, or the question they answered for
a stranger at midnight. Five small changes and one careful one are not the same thing in either
direction, and a number cannot tell you which is which. So these rungs are judgements, made by the
maintainers and written down where you can read them and disagree.

- **Contributor** — you landed a change. You are listed in [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](CONTRIBUTORS.md) with
  a link to it, so the entry is evidence rather than a thank-you. Use it wherever you need to show
  what you have shipped.
- **Trusted contributor** — someone we would hand an issue to without a conversation first. In
  practice: assign yourself any open labeled issue without asking, and your review on someone else's
  pull request is read as a review rather than a comment. Nothing to apply for and nothing to reach;
  we put you here, and the reason is written beside your name.
- **Area owner** — you own one area: a database provider, or a subsystem such as the Helm chart or
  the SQL editor. For a provider that means the triad the repository is built on — the code under
  `src/lib/db/providers/`, the doc under `docs/providers/` and the tests under
  `tests/integration/db/` move together, and a change to your area is reviewed with you. Offered by
  the maintainers, and offered to people who have already been answering questions about that area.
- **Maintainer** — carries the project: the releases, the review, and the decisions nobody else can
  make. Not a rung you climb to from the ones above it, which is why it is listed separately rather
  than at the top of the same ladder.

Maintainers are on [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](CONTRIBUTORS.md) alongside everyone else. Keeping their work
off the page would make it read as a guest list rather than a record, and the standard the page holds
people to is one they are held to as well. Bots and coding agents are not listed: `dependabot`,
`Copilot` and `claude` all appear in the commit history, none of them is a person, and putting them
beside people would blur the only thing the page is for.

Falling off a rung is not a thing. If you stop contributing, you keep what you earned.

**Maintainers:** adding the contributor to `CONTRIBUTORS.md` is part of merging an external pull
request, not a later sweep. `tests/unit/contributors-doc.test.ts` checks the page's shape and the
ladder's two halves against each other, but it deliberately does not check that the list is
complete — completeness cannot be measured in a shallow CI clone, so it stays a human step that is
honest about being one.

## Development Setup

### Devcontainer / Codespaces

Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces, or use **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container** in VS Code
with Docker running. [`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) provides
Node.js 24, Bun 1.4.2 and Helm 4.1.3, matching the required Node version and the Bun/Helm versions
used by CI, plus 7-Zip for the packaging tests. The first creation installs the locked JavaScript
dependencies and builds the chart's PostgreSQL dependency, so it needs access to the npm registry
and the chart registries.

JavaScript dependencies live in a container volume, keeping Linux native modules separate from
any dependencies installed on your host and avoiding slow shared-filesystem installs on Docker Desktop.

Once setup finishes, run the checks from step 4 in the container terminal. Start the app with
`bun run dev`; the container forwards port 3000. Database containers are optional and are not
started by this setup.

### Prerequisites

The suite runs on Linux, macOS and Windows, from whichever shell the platform gives you.
`bun run test` is `bun tests/run-tests.ts`, a TypeScript runner rather than a shell script, and CI runs it on ubuntu-latest, macos-latest and windows-latest.

| Tool | Version | Needed for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Bun](https://bun.sh/) | 1.4.2, the `packageManager` pin | Installing, the dev server, the build, and the test runner itself |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | 24+, the `engines` floor | The `scripts/*.mjs` gates, including `merge-lcov.mjs` and `check-coverage.mjs` |
| Git | any | Cloning, and on Windows it is also where the POSIX tools below come from |
| [Helm](https://helm.sh/) | 4.1.3, the version CI runs | Optional locally: the chart tests, see below |
| A POSIX shell plus `tar`, `zip`, `unzip` and `7z` | any | The packaging tests, which run the `packaging/` shell scripts and unpack what they produce |

Twelve of the thirteen `helm-chart-*.test.ts` files under `tests/unit/` spawn the `helm` binary; the exception is `helm-chart-readme-recipes.test.ts`, a static lint over the chart README.
Each of the twelve opens with `// @requires helm`, and the runner reads that before it starts a file.
Where `helm` is not on `PATH`, or the chart's PostgreSQL subchart is not built, `bun run test` does not start those files: it runs the rest, and its summary lists them under "Files not run on this machine" with the reason and the command that fixes it.
Selecting only chart tests on such a machine is an error rather than an empty green run.
CI sets `LIBREDB_REQUIRE_HELM=1`, which makes the same condition stop the run before anything starts, so the chart tests are never left out of a gate.
If you change the chart, install Helm and run them before you push.
A new test file that runs `helm` needs the marker too, and `tests/unit/test-runner-requirements.test.ts` fails until it has it.
To run the chart tests, install Helm; the PostgreSQL subchart tarball is gitignored (`*.tgz`), so a fresh clone also needs:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm dependency build charts/libredb-studio --skip-refresh
```

Trap: a stale `docker login` can make that build fail with `401 Unauthorized` from `registry-1.docker.io` even though the chart is anonymously pullable. `docker logout` fixes it.

A tool your platform does not have is not a failure here.
The tests that need it become skips whose titles carry the reason, the summary lists every one of them under its file at the end of the run, and `bun run test` still ends green.
So the table above is what you need to run the WHOLE suite; a machine without one of those tools runs the rest of it.

On Windows the POSIX tools come from the Git for Windows installation the clone already needed, and the tests locate them through git itself rather than through `PATH`.
PowerShell's `PATH` carries `git.exe` but not the `bin` and `usr\bin` directories beside it that hold `bash.exe`, `grep.exe` and `unzip.exe`, and where WSL is installed a bare `bash` does resolve, to `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe`, a Linux shell that cannot read the Windows temp paths the fixtures hand it.
So `tests/helpers/posix-tools.ts` asks the git binary for its exec path, derives the installation root from it, falls back to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Git` and the two `Program Files` defaults, and spawns each tool by absolute path; 7-Zip is looked for at `C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe` as well as on `PATH`.
Git for Windows carries no `zip`, so the tests that build the Azure package skip there whatever else you install (`docs/BACKLOG.md` D87).
Assertions about POSIX file modes skip on Windows in every case: NTFS has no exec bit, and Windows cannot exec an extension-less `#!` script.

macOS needs nothing of its own, and the one thing that used to stop it is gone: the old shell runner called `mapfile`, a bash 4 builtin that the system bash 3.2 does not have, and the runner is TypeScript now.
The gap that remains is `7z`, which the tests look for by that name, so an installation that provides only `7zz` leaves the standalone-zip packaging tests skipped.
`bash`, `tar`, `zip` and `unzip` come with the system, so everything else runs.

You do not need a `.env` file or a `data/` directory to run the tests.
`tests/setup.ts`, which `bunfig.toml` preloads into every test process, pins the credentials and settings the suite runs under, so a local `.env` cannot decide a test's outcome.

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/libredb-studio.git
cd libredb-studio

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Copy environment example
cp .env.example .env.local

# Start development server
bun dev
```

### Environment Variables

None are required: `bun dev` starts with an empty `.env.local` and the app's
zero-config first run generates the admin credentials and the JWT secret, printing
the password once to the dev-server output. Set them to pin known values instead
(`USER_PASSWORD` additionally creates the optional non-admin account, which is
never generated):
```env
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
USER_PASSWORD=user123
JWT_SECRET=your_32_character_random_string_here
```

Optional (for AI features):
```env
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
```

### Development Database

We provide a ready-to-use PostgreSQL setup with sample data for testing:

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL with sample e-commerce data
docker compose -f docker/postgres.yml up -d

# Connect with:
# Host: localhost, Port: 5432, Database: libredb_dev
# User: postgres, Password: postgres
```

**Includes:**
- PostgreSQL 17 with `pg_stat_statements` enabled
- E-commerce sample schema (customers, products, orders)
- 100+ records across multiple tables
- Pre-built views for reporting

> This is especially useful for testing the **Monitoring Dashboard** features.

```

### Security Scanning

Two checks run against every pull request. Both are reproducible locally, and
reproducing them is faster than waiting for CI.

**Committed secrets.** This one can fail your pull request. It scans only the
commits your branch adds:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo:ro" -w /repo \
  zricethezav/gitleaks@sha256:c00b6bd0aeb3071cbcb79009cb16a60dd9e0a7c60e2be9ab65d25e6bc8abbb7f \
  git --no-banner --redact --config /repo/.gitleaks.toml \
      --log-opts="--diff-merges=first-parent origin/main..HEAD"
```

If it reports a real credential, rotate it first — the value is already in every
clone. If it reports a fixture or placeholder, copy the finding's own
`Fingerprint` (`commit:file:rule:startline`, printed in the JSON report the
command above can produce with `--report-format json`) into `.gitleaksignore`
with a comment explaining why; that suppresses exactly this one finding, so a
real secret added later — even the same fabricated literal, in a new commit —
is still reported. `.gitleaks.toml`'s `[[allowlists]]` is for the narrower case
of a whole rule being unconditionally noisy for a reviewable reason, not for a
single fixture; an allowlist that names no `targetRules` is rejected by
`tests/unit/gitleaks-config.test.ts`, because it would exempt that path from
every rule the scanner has.

**Vulnerable dependencies.** This one reports on pull requests and never fails
them. The quickest local view needs no container:

```bash
bun audit
```

`bun audit` reports every severity and does not tell you whether a fix exists, so
expect a long list; it is a starting point, not a verdict. The scan CI actually
runs covers the npm, Rust and Go ecosystems together (`bun.lock`,
`desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.lock`, the launcher's `go.mod`) and includes the
fixed-version column `bun audit` lacks:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/repo:ro" -w /repo \
  aquasec/trivy@sha256:7cced7cae583819fc7806d4cbc0dbbc7cad18b99f7d3e235192e6da8c091045c \
  fs --scanners vuln --ignorefile /repo/.trivyignore.yaml \
     --skip-dirs node_modules --skip-dirs .next --skip-dirs dist --skip-dirs coverage .
```

Only a CRITICAL finding with an available fix gates anything, and only outside
pull requests. If you hit one, take the fix and commit `bun.lock`. Suppressing it
in `.trivyignore.yaml` is the last resort and requires a justification and an
expiry date.

### Helm Chart Changes

Touching anything packaged under `charts/libredb-studio/` pulls in two invariants
that CI enforces and that nothing in the chart itself hints at. Both are checked
by one command, and running it locally is faster than reading a CI log:

```bash
bun run chart:check
```

**The operator carries a verbatim copy.** `operator/helm-charts/libredb-studio/`
is a byte-for-byte mirror of the source chart, because the OLM operator embeds
the chart rather than fetching it. Never hand-edit the copy — change the source
chart and regenerate:

```bash
bun run chart:bump
```

**An already-released chart version cannot be re-published.** Chart releases are
immutable: re-publishing a version that already has a `libredb-studio-<version>`
tag would mutate the released index entry and the OCI digest that existing users
resolve (#167). So when the current `version:` in `Chart.yaml` is already tagged,
raise it by hand — both `version:` in `Chart.yaml` and the `--version` example in
`charts/libredb-studio/README.md`.

`chart:bump` deliberately will *not* raise `version:` for you while `appVersion`
is already in sync with `package.json`, so this step is easy to miss; `chart:check`
is what catches it. `appVersion` tracks the app's `package.json` version and is
the one field `chart:bump` does maintain.

Finally, the chart should lint clean:

```bash
helm dependency build charts/libredb-studio
helm lint charts/libredb-studio --strict
```

CI's test and lint lanes run Helm 4.1.3, so that is the client to develop against.
That is not the chart's floor: the chart README states Helm >= 3.12, and CI's only
Helm 3 evidence is 3.16.0. The release workflow's `ct install` job stays on Helm 3.16
deliberately, so a Helm 3 client keeps installing the chart source - see
`tests/unit/helm-pin-matrix.test.ts`, and R1 in `docs/BACKLOG.md` for what that
still does not cover.
