/**
 * The chart's `agent` block (#331 T8).
 *
 * T5 made agent availability DERIVED — a configured model plus a writable ledger —
 * and left `LIBREDB_AGENT_ENABLED` as the explicit off-switch whose default is
 * *auto*. The chart is the last place that still stated the pre-T5 default, and a
 * chart that hard-codes a value would undo the derivation for every Kubernetes
 * install. So the rules under test are:
 *
 *  1. **A default render writes no `LIBREDB_AGENT_ENABLED`, and DOES write the
 *     ledger directory.** The second half is not a duplicated default for its own
 *     sake, it is the release topology: `image.tag` defaults to `.Chart.AppVersion`,
 *     and the Dockerfile's `WORKFLOW_LOCAL_DATA_DIR` landed after that app version
 *     was tagged. So the image a default install actually pulls has no such ENV, its
 *     ledger resolves to `.workflow-data` under `WORKDIR /app`, and
 *     `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` makes that unwritable — the probe answers
 *     `LEDGER_UNAVAILABLE` on a chart that advertises a working agent. The chart
 *     reaches users before the image does, so the chart sets it. Both copies name the
 *     same path and a test below holds them to it.
 *  2. **The off-switch is a values field, not an `extraEnv` recipe.** `agent.enabled:
 *     false` writes the variable as a STRING, which is what removes the `--set-string`
 *     trap the README used to have to explain (`EnvVar.value` is a string, and a bare
 *     `--set …=true` renders an unquoted YAML `true` the API server rejects).
 *  3. **Multi-replica with a possible agent fails to render.** The zero-config ledger
 *     takes file locks and each pod gets its own `emptyDir`, so a run started on one
 *     pod is invisible to the next request. The only backend that lifts it
 *     (`@workflow/world-postgres`) is not loadable in the published image at all
 *     (docs/BACKLOG.md B16), so the message has to say that rather than sell an
 *     opt-in that does not exist yet.
 *
 * Exercises real `helm template` output — no reimplementation of the templates.
