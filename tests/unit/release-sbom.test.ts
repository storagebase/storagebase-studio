/**
 * Unit tests for the release SBOM (security programme control 2.2).
 *
 * Why a test for YAML: dropping the SBOM does not break a release. Every other
 * asset still uploads, publish-release still flips the draft, and the missing
 * document is discovered by whoever asked for it in a procurement thread months
 * later - by which time immutable releases mean it can never be added to that
 * release at all. That asymmetry is the same one release-provenance.test.ts
 * exists for.
 *
 * The licence assertion is not cosmetic either: with no node_modules present
 * Trivy emits the same component list with zero licence fields and logs a notice
 * nobody reads, so the SBOM would look complete and answer none of the questions
 * a diligence reviewer asks it.
