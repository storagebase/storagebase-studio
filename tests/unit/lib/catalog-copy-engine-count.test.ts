/**
 * The accuracy gate for the engine COUNT in outward-facing catalog copy (#518).
 *
 * Twelve files outside `src/` name the engine set by hand, and until this test nothing
 * counted them: `scripts/readme-check.mjs` locates the engine table in the three
 * READMEs and `chart:check` pins a version across files, but a storefront listing was
 * only ever corrected by somebody noticing. Measured on the DuckDB registration branch,
 * every one of the original nine was a full engine behind two weeks after libSQL shipped
 * (#511), and DuckDB was the second engine in a row to walk into it.
 *
 * The rule is not "every file names every engine" - several of them deliberately
 * abridge, because a numeral there goes stale the day the next engine lands (#445). It
 * is:
 *
 * 1. a numeral qualifying the word "engines" must equal `EXTERNAL_DATABASE_TYPES.length`;
 * 2. where that numeral introduces a LIST, the list must name every one of them, by the
 *    `DB_UI_CONFIG` labels rather than by a copy of the names kept here.
 *
 * A numeral that qualifies a NARROWER noun ("the two search engines") is not a claim
 * about the product's set and is left alone, and an explicitly abridged list ("and
 * more", "among them", "from X ... to Y") is checked on its numeral only.
