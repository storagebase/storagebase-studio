/**
 * The groups the source declares, restated here so each one is named by a test.
 *
 * This used to be `expect(Object.keys(ApiErrorCode)).toHaveLength(18)`, which pinned a
 * MAGNITUDE. A magnitude is the wrong thing to assert: adding a code fails the gate
 * with "expected 18, received 19", which says nothing about what was added, and the
 * only way through is to edit the digit - so the guard taught everybody to edit it
 * rather than to think. #789 added a code and then removed it again, hitting that twice.
 *
 * What the count was actually FOR is exhaustiveness: a code added to the source and
 * named by none of the group tests below was invisible, so the groups could drift into
 * covering a subset while every test stayed green. That is the property worth keeping,
 * and it is derived here rather than counted: the union of the groups must equal the
 * declared keys, in both directions. A new code fails the gate by NAME until it is
 * filed under a group, and a code deleted from the source fails it too.
