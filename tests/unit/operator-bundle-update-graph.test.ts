/**
 * Where the committed OLM bundle sits in the community catalogs' update graph,
 * and which half of that graph the repo is allowed to know.
 *
 * `olm.skipRange` is derivable from package.json, so the repo owns it:
 * `make -C operator bundle` stamps `>=0.0.0 <$(VERSION)` and greps it back.
 * An unparseable range is *ignored with a log warning* upstream rather than
 * rejected, so a typo would silently degrade to no range at all - hence the
 * exact-string assertion rather than a loose match.
 *
 * `spec.replaces` is deliberately ABSENT, and that absence is the invariant
 * this file exists to hold. Its only correct value is the version immediately
 * preceding this one *in a given catalog*, which is external state: it lags
 * our releases by however many submissions are unmerged, it differs between
 * the two catalogs, and nothing in this repo can derive it. Stamping a
 * declared value here (what `CATALOG_REPLACES` did) makes the committed bundle
 * correct only by coincidence and stale by default, which is a cost paid on
 * every release.
 *
 * So the field is derived and injected at submission time instead, from the
 * catalog being submitted to. See docs/DISTRIBUTION.md, "The update graph".
 *
 * The consequence is worth stating plainly, because it looks like an omission:
 * this bundle on its own does NOT pass `opm index add --mode replaces`, which
 * reads `spec.replaces` and `spec.skips` and never `olm.skipRange`. That is
 * intended. Adding a `replaces` here to "fix" it reintroduces the stale value,
 * which is why the absence is asserted rather than merely documented.
