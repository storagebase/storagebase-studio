/**
 * Unit tests for the deb/rpm postinstall service-restart contract
 * (packaging/linux/scripts/postinstall.sh, wired by packaging/linux/nfpm.yaml).
 *
 * The script is exercised as a real subprocess against a stub "systemctl"
 * placed first on PATH; the stub appends its own argv to a log file, so the
 * assertions are about the observable sequence of systemctl invocations
 * rather than about the script's text. LIBREDB_SYSTEMD_RUNTIME_DIR points the
 * systemd probe at a temp directory, so the outcome never depends on whether
 * the host running the tests is booted with systemd.
