/**
 * Unit tests for the chart release's title and notes in helm-release.yml.
 *
 * Why a test for release copy: this text is the only explanation a visitor to
 * the Releases page ever gets for why the repository carries two version
 * streams - the application (`0.13.4`) and the chart
 * (`storagebase-studio-0.1.49`). It used to be the chart's one-line `description:`
 * repeated verbatim on every chart release, which answers a question nobody
 * asked. The failure mode of the replacement is equally silent: a stale
 * version placeholder still renders (as literal `__CHART_VERSION__`), a
 * doc link whose anchor drifted still renders (as a link to the top of the
 * file), and an unquoted heredoc silently executes the `$(...)` and backticks
 * inside the markdown instead of printing them. None of these fails a run.
 *
 * Same asymmetry as tests/unit/security-scan-workflow.test.ts, applied to the
 * one workflow step whose output is read by humans rather than by tooling.
