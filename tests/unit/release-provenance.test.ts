/**
 * Unit tests for the signed-provenance invariants of the publish workflows
 * (issue #123: npm provenance + SLSA build provenance).
 *
 * Why a test for YAML: dropping `--provenance` does NOT break a release. The
 * publish still succeeds, the tarball just ships unsigned - the guarantee
 * disappears silently and nobody notices until someone tries to verify a
 * months-old version. Dropping `id-token: write` fails the other way, loudly,
 * but only on the release commit, where the retry costs a whole patch version
 * (a published tag can never be re-published). Both directions are cheap to
 * pin here and expensive to discover in a live release.
 *
 * The same asymmetry drives the attestation assertions below: an artifact that
 * is uploaded before it is attested, or a job that lost `attestations: write`,
 * produces a release whose assets look fine and cannot be verified.
