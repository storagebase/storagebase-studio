/**
 * Unit tests for security-scan.yml's invariants.
 *
 * Why a test for YAML: every failure mode here is silent. A scanner pinned to
 * `:latest` still runs, it just stops being the scanner that was reviewed. A
 * `continue-on-error` on the secret scan still shows a green check. A SARIF
 * upload without the fork guard fails only on a fork's pull request, which the
 * maintainer never sees on their own branches. None of these breaks a run; each
 * removes a guarantee.
 *
 * The same asymmetry as tests/unit/release-provenance.test.ts, applied to the
