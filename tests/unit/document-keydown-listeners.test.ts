/**
 * The global keydown listeners, derived from the source rather than quoted from a grep nobody runs.
 *
 * Three shipped docblocks now enumerate these: `src/components/Studio.tsx`,
 * `src/workspace/StudioWorkspace.tsx` and the D82 block in
 * `tests/components/studio/embedded-source.test.tsx`. Each one exists because an apply dialog
 * cannot refuse a listener registered on `document`, so what is registered there decides whether
 * the D82 window is closed. Each was written by running a grep and copying its answer.
 *
 * That is how the previous sentence became false: it said there were TWO document listeners for as
 * long as that was true, `DataProfiler` added a third, and nothing noticed until a reviewer ran the
 * grep again. A sixth registration, or a fifth that moves to `document`, would make all three
 * sentences false in the same silence.
 *
 * So the grep runs here. This asserts the SITES, not the count: a bare number tells the next reader
 * nothing about which file grew a listener, and a diff that swaps one registration for another
 * would keep a count green.
