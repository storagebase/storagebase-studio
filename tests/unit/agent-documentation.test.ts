/**
 * Drift guards for the agent runtime's cross-cutting documentation (#329 T13).
 *
 * The agent runtime is the first feature in this repository whose behaviour is
 * spread across a dozen modules, six API route paths, a rail, a durable backend and a
 * chart constraint, and none of that is derivable from any single file. `docs/AGENT.md`
 * is where it is written down. These tests keep three kinds of claim honest, because
 * prose is the one part of the repository nothing else checks:
 *
 *  1. **The document is reachable.** A behaviour document nobody links is a document
 *     nobody reads, so `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` must link it and the link must resolve.
 *  2. **The configuration surface is complete.** Every environment variable the agent
 *     modules read is documented in BOTH `.env.example` and `docs/AGENT.md`, and the
 *     companion assertion is what keeps that check honest: across every agent-owned file
 *     (the runtime, the routes, the rail, its hooks, the run-access helper) only
 *     `config.ts` touches `process.env`, so a fourth variable read from one of them
 *     cannot slip past undocumented.
 *  3. **The deferral record is complete in both directions.** Every M2 backlog entry is
 *     cited by the behaviour document, and every id the document cites exists. A
 *     milestone that defers work and then documents nothing, or documents an entry that
 *     was later deleted, fails here rather than misleading a reader.
 *
 * The chart block covers the one deployment constraint the runtime imposes (the
 * zero-config durable backend takes file locks, so it is single-instance) plus the
 * verbatim operator copy of the chart, which is the mistake a chart edit made outside
 * `bun run chart:bump` actually produces — CI catches it, and the maintainer loop
 * cannot push, so this is the only local guard.

 * scanned path below is POSIX-spelled - the `src/app` prefix stripped off a route, the
 * route path looked up in `docs/API_DOCS.md`, the comparison against
 * `src/lib/agent/config.ts` - and so is the documentation being searched, which no
 * platform rewrites. So the separator is normalised once where the paths are produced

 * Unconditional, not a win32 branch: a tracked path holding a backslash cannot be
