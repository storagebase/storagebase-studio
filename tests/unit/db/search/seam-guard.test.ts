/**
 * Elasticsearch / OpenSearch transport seam guard (issue #424, Phase 1)
 *
 * ONE provider implementation serves TWO type-ids, and that is only affordable
 * while everything the two products disagree about lives in exactly one file.
 * `transport.ts:40-43` states the rule and names this test as its enforcement:
 * provider logic, introspection and monitoring read the neutral
 * `SearchQueryResult` / `SearchIndexInfo` / `SearchTransportError` through the seam,
 * so `http-transport.ts` is the only file allowed to know a path, an envelope key, a
 * product fault name, an HTTP status code or `fetch`. This test parses every source
 * in the directory from disk - not from a list - and fails the build the moment that
 * stops being true.
 *
 * The guard is a parser, not a grep, and the vocabulary is sorted into classes
 * because the classes need different treatment. What forces that here is sharper
 * than in Couchbase (#262) or Druid (#265): the NEUTRAL seam deliberately reuses the
 * wire's own English. `SearchQueryResult.rows`, `columnTypes`, `DatabaseObject.sizeBytes`,
 * the object reads, `options.schema` and `SEARCH_CONTAINER_TYPES = ["object", "nested"]`
 * are all legitimate, and `rows` / `schema` / `size` are simultaneously envelope
 * keys on the wire (`{columns,rows}` on Elasticsearch against
 * `{schema,datarows,total,size}` on OpenSearch, measured). So those words are
 * matched ONLY as exact STRING literals - the spelling that envelope PARSING
 * produces - and a bare property access is left alone. A guard that cries wolf is a
 * guard the next contributor deletes.
 *
 * Deliberate holes, each cheaper than a false positive:
 * - `"type"`, `"status"`, `"error"`, `"number"` and `"query"` are NOT flagged as
 *   keys. Every one is an envelope member (`error.type`, the `_cat` status,
 *   `version.number`, the request body's `query`), and every one is also ordinary
 *   product English that will appear in a label, a `typeof` test or a metric key.
 *   The payloads they belong to are fingerprinted by their unmistakable members
 *   instead (`cluster_name`, `docs.count`, `root_cause`, ...).
 * - `"object"` and `"nested"` are NOT flagged at all: they are mapping type VALUES
 *   that cross the seam as `SearchMappingField.type` data, which is why
 *   `introspect.ts:90` may name them and `transport.ts:175` names `object` in its
 *   own doc comment.
 * - HTTP **200** is not in the status set: it is the one status that carries no
 *   classification (categorisation here is body-driven, `transport.ts:26-32`), and
 *   200 is a plausible row limit.
 *
 * Both directions are proven below: the detector must light up on the file that is
 * SUPPOSED to speak HTTP, and stay silent on a compliant one.
