/**
 * The accuracy gate for outward-facing marketplace copy.
 *
 * These six files are copy submitted to somebody else's catalog: Railway,
 * DigitalOcean, SUSE PCSC, Azure Partner Center, the AWS Marketplace Management Portal,
 * and the app-readme overlay Rancher renders. Nobody in this repo reviews them again once
 * they are submitted - the first five by mail, the last by a pull request against
 * `rancher/partner-charts`, where no test here can reach the copy that ships - so the only
 * thing standing between a corrected claim and its return is a test.
 *
 * A previous revision replaced a false natural-language-to-SQL claim with two new
 * ones - "AI query explanation on any connection" (true on 7 of the 14 engines) and
 * "never executes what it recommends" (the consented hand-over runs exactly the
 * recommended statement) - which is why the gate is phrase-level rather than a review
 * note in the file itself: a file that audits itself against a false line is worse than
 * one that does not.
 *
 * The explain-capable set is DERIVED from the providers, never listed here. The UI hides
 * the Explain tab unless the provider declares `explainFormat`
 * (`src/components/studio/BottomPanel.tsx`), so the set of files declaring it IS the set
 * of engines the copy may name - and an engine that gains or loses a plan format moves
 * this test's expectation on its own, the way `src/lib/agent/posture.ts` derives every
 * engine name it prints.
