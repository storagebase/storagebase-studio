/**
 * Unit tests for the DigitalOcean 1-Click Droplet build (deploy/digitalocean/droplet).

 * Nothing here reaches DigitalOcean. These assert the invariants whose violation is
 * invisible in a green Packer build and only surfaces on a buyer's Droplet: an
 * environment file written without the flag that makes plain-HTTP login work, a
 * secret that stopped being generated per instance, or an env file that stopped
 * being written with a restrictive mode.
 *
 * The AWS sibling is guarded the same way in aws-ami-descriptor.test.ts. The two
 * images ship the same shape - a bare VM reached over plain HTTP at :3000 with no
 * name of its own - so they need the same invariants held.
