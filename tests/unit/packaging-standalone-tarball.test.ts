/**
 * Unit test for the standalone tarball layout fix (issue #133): the release

 * instead of spilling its ~50 files into the caller's current directory
 * (a tarbomb). Exercises the real `scripts/lib/pack-standalone-tarball.sh`
 * as a subprocess against a small fixture payload dir - no full `bun run
 * build` needed, since that script only wraps an already-assembled payload.
