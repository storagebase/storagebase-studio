/**
 * The standalone shell's half of the object source seam (#789 Phase 2).
 *
 * The contract, the route, the viewer and twelve providers landed before this, and none of
 * them was reachable by a person. This file drives the four things that make one: the row
 * menu's handler, the ACTIVATION split, the tab that carries the address, and the pane that
 * hands a document from the route to the viewer.
 *
 * What is REAL here and why. `useTabManager` is real, because the tab is the subject: a stub
 * would make every assertion below a statement about the stub, and Phase 1's own lesson is
 * that the seam between two mocked halves is exactly where a feature fails in a browser.
 * `StudioTabBar` is real for the same reason, reached by its own path so the mocked barrel
 * cannot replace it. `ObjectSourceView` is real, over a `@monaco-editor/react` double that
 * surfaces the value and the language, so the definition a reader would SEE is what is
 * asserted. And `globalThis.fetch` answers the source route, so the read is a real round trip
 * through `httpSourceReader` rather than an injected reader nothing in production uses.
 *
 * What is mocked is everything the shell mounts BESIDE this: the sidebar, the modals, the
 * bottom panel and the query editor. Their own suites cover them, and Studio's own suite
 * covers this shell's other decisions.
