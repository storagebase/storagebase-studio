/**
 * The standalone agent rail (#329 T10a): the gated surface, its two modes and the
 * run timeline.
 *
 * What these tests pin beyond rendering:
 *
 *  - **Planning is the mode a run opens in**, and switching is free. The server
 *    decides what a mode may do (T6 selects the tool set from the run's persisted
 *    mode); this surface only decides what it ASKS for, and it asks for the
 *    toolless one unless the user says otherwise.
 *  - **A connection the server cannot resolve is refused here, with a reason.** T9
 *    pinned that a run needs a `seed:` connection because a resumed drive re-resolves
 *    it server-side, so the rail says so instead of posting a request that can only
 *    400.
 *  - **The timeline survives a stream that does not arrive in whole lines**, which is
 *    the normal case for NDJSON over a real connection.

    Every reason the SERVER can decline a carry for, and the WHOLE sentence each one
    gets. A `Record` over the union rather than a hand-written row list, and both halves
    of that shape are load-bearing.

    The KEYS are the gate the production `switch` cannot supply on its own. `TS2366`
    there catches a fifth member that needs a sentence of its own, but a member folded
    onto the shared `unavailable`/`error` return adds only a bare `case` label: no
    executable line, so `typecheck` passes and the 100% line gate reads 100% with the
    new code rendered by no test (measured 2026-08-27 — fifth member `"rotated"` folded
    onto the shared arm: `typecheck` clean, 254 pass / 0 fail, `AgentRail.tsx` still
    100.00% lines). Missing an entry here is `TS2741` IN THIS FILE, whatever arm the
    reason is folded onto.

    The VALUES are whole sentences because fragments let a reword through: three of
    these four were `toContain` fragments, and prepending "MUTATED " to their arms one
    at a time left the suite at 254 pass / 0 fail three times out of four. `toBe` also
    subsumes the negative that used to ride along here — the rail's own "Connection
    changed" sentence is not an acceptable answer to any of these rows, and now it is
    not an acceptable answer to any of them character for character.

    Since #512 the re-pointed connection carries its own code, because it is the only
    decline that is not a failure — every check the route makes passed, and the server
    refused the carry on purpose. Both halves of that sentence are pinned, because the
    half that was wrong was the second one: it claimed the decline persists until the
    connection is pointed back, and the route writes the CURRENT identity onto the run it
    opens, so the next follow-up continues off THAT run and carries normally.

    Not "could not be reached" for the five under `unavailable` either: the sentence
    still has to be true of every cause it covers, and one of them is a predecessor that
    simply has not ended yet, which can be reached perfectly well.

   *    different feature from one that filled in a question.
   *  - **An objective the user typed is never discarded.** Not overwritten, and not
   *    dropped either — the ask waits on a line they can accept, because a shortcut
   *    that appeared to do nothing would read as broken.
   *  - **Both presentations, one instance.** The panel above `md` and the sheet below
   *    it are branches of the same component, so an ask has to land in whichever one is
   *    rendering; a seam wired into a single branch is the failure this task exists to
   *    prevent. Including the branch `useIsMobile` has not resolved into yet: the T1
   *    adversarial review found that an ask present in the first committed render on a
   *    narrow viewport reached the invisible one, and the recheck then found the
   *    workaround for that leaving a debt a later narrowing paid on a desktop. The
   *    three tests at the end of this block hold the reading that removed both.

   *
   * Plan mode's deliverable is now a ledger fact rather than a fence the browser
   * happened to find (item 5), and this is where the user meets it. Three of the four
   * tests below are about a claim rather than a control, because that is where this
   * surface can do harm:
   *
   *  - **A write must be unmissable, and not only to a sighted user.** The owner ruled
   *    that plan mode may draft one; what it may never do is let "Apply to editor" put
   *    a `DELETE` in the editor as though it were a `SELECT`. A colour says that to
   *    nobody using a screen reader, so the mark rides in the button's own accessible
   *    name.
   *  - **A finding must sit beside the statement it is about.** A table the inventory
   *    does not hold is what the identifier check exists to surface; swallowed, it
   *    leaves an unvalidated statement looking like a sound one.
   *  - **The refusal marker is a protocol token and never copy.** It reaches the user
   *    stripped, inside a card that says what the outcome is.

  /**
   * The rail's 2026-08-21 redesign: what MOVED, and the three claims that may not move
   * with it.
   *
   * Nothing here changes what a run does, what the ledger records or what any claim says.
   * What changed is where a reader meets each of them, which is why these tests are about
   * placement and derivation rather than about copy:
   *
   *  - **the safety strip states what the selected MODE executes**, on one axis, from one
   *    module (`src/lib/agent/posture.ts`). The rail used to answer that question in six
   *    places at once;
   *  - **the engine notice gates nothing.** It presents a refusal the provider factory
   *    makes, and one workflow — operations — runs on those engines regardless, so a
   *    disabled Start would take a working thing away over a claim untrue of it;
   *  - **the budget's three claims moved behind an ⓘ each and are still exactly
   *    themselves.** A claim that is harder to reach is a decision; a claim that is
   *    reworded on the way is a different claim.

        #513, measured in Chrome on 2026-08-27: a refused agent start on the bundled
        LibreDB sample rendered the posture's whole 406-character paragraph in the red
        error line, while the amber card two elements above was showing the identical
        paragraph. The operator was told the same four sentences twice, once as a standing
        explanation and once as the outcome of the action they had just taken.

        Reusing the posture is right - a third phrasing of one fact is worse - so what
        these tests pin is the REGISTER: an error line owes the consequence and a pointer,
        and the paragraph stays the card's.

        Answering every request with the 400 is the shape `survives a start the server
        refused` already uses: the classify call falls back to an unclassified
        investigation, which is a statement-sending workflow, and the run POST is refused.

      /*
        The strip's claim node is taken out before counting, and that is a property of the
        panel rather than a convenience: `SafetyStrip` renders the posture body into
        `agent-safety-claim` on EVERY render - `sr-only` when shut, a popover when open -
        because it is the `aria-describedby` target for the mode pill and may never be
        reachable only by clicking. So on an unsupported engine in agent mode the paragraph
        is in the DOM twice before any start is refused, once as that description and once

       * the one path where three unmarked hand-offs is worse than the one `main` had.

       *  - the transcript withholds a hand-off for the statement the card is handing
       *    over, which is the report path's version of what the plan path already did to
       *    the prose the statement was read out of. By the TEXT, not by the entry id: it
       *    is a de-duplication of one statement, so a read the run took along the way
