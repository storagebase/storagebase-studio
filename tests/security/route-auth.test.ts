  // through a NEW indirect helper would still pass. `@/lib/api/schema-route` is the one such
  // helper that exists on the non-allowlisted side, and it is only covered above because
  // somebody thought to name it.
  //
  // Resolving the import graph transitively was measured 2026-08-27 and rejected: it flags four
  // of the fifteen allowlisted routes, all of them wrongly. The three `agent/runs/*` routes reach
  // `@/lib/agent/runtime`, which does import `@/lib/db` - but for the in-process
  // `ExecutionArtifactStore` the route reads, not for a provider; `agent/config` reaches
  // `@/lib/llm/utils/config` to validate a model id. A module-level graph cannot tell an import
  // used on this route's path from a sibling in the same file, so transitively it answers "reaches
  // a provider" for every route that touches a shared module - a guard that is red for correct
  // code teaches people to widen it.
  //
  // So the SET of indirect helpers is pinned instead. A new one cannot appear unnoticed: it has to
  // be added here with a reason, and adding it is where the judgement gets made.
  //
  // Each reason also carries whether the helper names a provider module of its own, and both
  // directions are enforced below - a helper that GROWS a provider import fails until its reason
  // says so, and a stale marker on a helper that lost one fails too, so the marker cannot rot into
