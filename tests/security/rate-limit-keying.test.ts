/**
 * Threat: an attacker who evades the limiter, or weaponises it against a legitimate user.
 *
 * X-Forwarded-For is attacker-controlled and the design does not depend on it being trustworthy.
 * NextRequest exposes no socket address, so ignoring forwarded headers would collapse every
 * anonymous caller into one shared bucket and turn the login limiter into a remote lockout switch
 * - strictly worse than a spoofable key. The compensating control is the account bucket, which is
 * keyed on the submitted account and is unaffected by header spoofing.
