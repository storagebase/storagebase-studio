/**
 * What a test file needs from the machine it runs on, and what the runner does about it.
 *
 * A file declares a requirement with one line of its own, `// @requires helm`, and the runner
 * reads it before starting the file:
 *
 * - where the requirement is met, the file runs like any other;
 * - where it is not, the file is not started, and the summary names it under the reason, once;
 * - where the run REQUIRES it (`LIBREDB_REQUIRE_HELM=1`, which every CI job that runs the suite
 *   sets), a missing requirement stops the whole run before anything starts.
 *
 * The chart tests are why this exists. They drive the real `helm` binary against a PostgreSQL
 * subchart that has to be downloaded, and a contributor who never touches the chart should not
 * have to install either to see `bun run test` go green. The decision is made per FILE rather
 * than per test because every one of those files needs Helm for everything it does: skipping
 * inside them would list about 180 test names on a machine without Helm, where one line per file
 * says the same thing. CI keeps them mandatory, so nothing is quietly left out of the gate.
 *
 * `tests/unit/test-runner-requirements.test.ts` holds the marker true of the whole tree in both
 * directions: a file that runs helm declares it, and a file that declares it runs helm.
