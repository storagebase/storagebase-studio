/**
 * OpenSearch Provider Integration Tests (issue #424, Phase 1)
 *
 * globalThis.fetch is replaced per test and restored in afterEach, so the real
 * transport, the real introspection and the real provider all run - only the
 * cluster is fake. mock.module() is deliberately not used: it is process-wide in
 * bun and would poison sibling test files.
 *
 * Every payload below was captured from a live OpenSearch 3.8.0 cluster on
 * 2026-08-19 (security disabled, stock single node, indices `probe_orders` and
 * `probe_shapes`), so the fake speaks exactly what the server speaks.
 *
 * THIS FILE'S JOB IS THE DIVERGENCE. One implementation serves two type-ids
 * (`src/lib/db/providers/sql/search/index.ts:11-16`), and the Elasticsearch
 * sibling covers the behaviour the two share; what is asserted here is what
 * OpenSearch does DIFFERENTLY, so that "two type-ids, one implementation" is a
 * tested claim rather than an assumption. The seven measured differences the
 * assertions below are built on:
 *
 * - The success envelope is `schema`/`datarows` with `total` and `size` beside it,
 *   not Elasticsearch's `columns`/`rows` with no count at all
 *   (`http-transport.ts:357-364`).
 * - `SELECT customer AS who` declares `{"name":"customer","alias":"who"}` here and
 *   `{"name":"who"}` on Elasticsearch, so reading `name` alone would put the WRONG
 *   label on the same statement's column (`http-transport.ts:285-295`).
 * - A missing index is HTTP **404** (`IndexNotFoundException`) where Elasticsearch
 *   answers HTTP 400 - the same typo, two statuses, which is why categorisation is
 *   body-driven (`http-transport.ts:35-42`).
 * - The SQL plugin names its faults with JAVA CLASSES
 *   (`SQLFeatureNotSupportedException`, `SemanticCheckException`,
 *   `EOFParserException`, ...) while the CORE REST layer keeps Elasticsearch's
 *   lineage and answers `index_not_found_exception` in snake_case, so one product
 *   speaks both vocabularies depending on which endpoint replied
 *   (`http-transport.ts:377-384`).
 * - `SELECT 1 AS c, 2 AS c` is REFUSED here (`IllegalArgumentException`, "Multiple
 *   entries with same key") and answers 200 with three columns named `c` on
 *   Elasticsearch, so the seam's uniqueness invariant is load-bearing on exactly
 *   one of the two products (`http-transport.ts:24-31`).
 * - `LIMIT n OFFSET m` is accepted here and is a syntax error on Elasticsearch,
 *   which is the one behavioural difference ABOVE the wire (`index.ts:225-230`).
 * - A stock node ships system indices the dot rule alone does not catch:
 *   `.plugins-ml-config` AND `top_queries-<date>-<n>`, so two of four indices on a
 *   cluster holding two probe indices are not the user's
 *   (`http-transport.ts:252-264`).
 *
 * Where a divergence is only visible below the provider - a fault CATEGORY, for
 * instance, since four of them collapse onto one `QueryError` by design
 * (`index.ts:685-689`) - the transport is driven directly. That is the seam the
 * categorisation lives on, and asserting it through a class that erases it would
 * have tested nothing.
