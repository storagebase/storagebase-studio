# of its LAST command - a first-stage failure part-way through would hand the
# second stage a truncated stream, which can still exit 0 and leave a partial
# tree. Flatpak verifies the extra-data digest before this script runs, so a
# corrupt download cannot get here, but a full disk mid-unpack can. /bin/sh is
# bash in org.gnome.Platform; the subshell probe keeps this a no-op rather than
# a hard failure on a shell without pipefail.

# Runs offline at install time inside org.gnome.Platform (issue #241).
#
# The upstream Debian package is a plain FHS tree holding three things: the
# Tauri shell (usr/bin/storagebase-studio-desktop), the pinned Node runtime it
# starts as a sidecar (usr/bin/storagebase-studio-node) and the standalone Next.js
# server payload (usr/lib/storagebase-studio-desktop/payload). The relative layout
# is load-bearing - the shell resolves its resources as
# <exe dir>/../lib/<product name> - so the whole usr tree is kept as-is at
# /app/extra/usr rather than cherry-picking the binary.
#
# The desktop file, icon and AppStream metainfo are shipped by the manifest at
# *build* time: extra-data is fetched later on the user's machine, so anything
# Flatpak has to export cannot come from here.

# The apply_extra sandbox has no locale configured, and bsdtar prints
# "Failed to set default locale" twice on every install without this. Harmless,
# but it is the only output a user sees from this script, so it reads like a
# packaging fault.
