/**
 * Gate 5 for issue #424 Phase 2.
 *
 * The unit and integration tests drive the provider through a fake transport, so they
 * prove the code is right and prove nothing about whether a user can reach it.
 * Everything a new type-id needs in order to be SELECTABLE lives outside the provider
 * - the `DatabaseType` union, `DB_UI_CONFIG`, `selectableTypes`, an icon export - and
 * a miss in any of them leaves a provider that works and cannot be picked. Several of
 * those surfaces are not type-enforced, which is exactly why this runs in a browser.
 *
 * The two assertions that are specific to THIS engine, and that no other spec here
 * makes, are the catalog field and the password warning: both are consequences of
 * live measurements against Trino 476 that a mocked test cannot reach.
