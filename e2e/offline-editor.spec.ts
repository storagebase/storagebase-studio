/**
 * Air-gapped workspace (issue #247): with every off-origin request blocked, the SQL
 * editor must still render and run a query.
 *
 * Before Monaco was self-hosted, @monaco-editor/react fetched it from cdn.jsdelivr.net:
 * the editor pane stayed a spinner forever on an isolated network, while the rest of the
 * app looked healthy — and the Channel E2E gate flaked whenever the runner could not
 * reach the CDN. The existing specs pass *because* the CDN is reachable, which is the
 * wrong thing to assert for a self-hosted product, so this one asserts the opposite:
 * nothing the workspace needs comes from another host.
 *
 * Runs under playwright.config.ts's "chromium-offline-editor" project, against its own server
 * process, not the shared one every other spec uses. It logs in as the same user@storagebase.org
 * account as everything else in this suite and asserts on the query's actual result value, so it
 * is the one spec that visibly breaks if that account's "query" rate-limit bucket
 * (src/lib/api/rate-limit.ts) is already spent by the ~30 other tests' auto-hydration on the
 * shared server before this one gets its turn - see the webServer/projects comments there.
