/**
 * The supported models, driven through the APPLICATION rather than through its API.
 *
 * Every figure in `docs/llms/` came from runs opened over HTTP: real runs against a real database
 * with a real model, but never once through the rail a user actually clicks. That gap is the
 * whole reason this file exists — "the agent works with this model" and "a person can get an
 * answer out of this model in the product" are two claims, and only one of them was measured.
 *
 * So this logs in, picks the embedded sample connection, types an objective into the rail,
 * presses Start, and waits for the run to finish on screen. What it asserts is what the user
 * sees: the run reaches a terminal state and the rail shows the answer rather than a failure.
 *
 * It tests whichever model the SERVER is configured with — the model is an environment variable
 * and there is no picker in the product — so the loop over the ten lives in
 * `scripts/agent-model-e2e.sh`, which sets the model, restarts, and runs this file once per model.
