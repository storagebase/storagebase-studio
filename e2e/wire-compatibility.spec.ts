/**
 * Gate 5 for issue #424 Phase 0.
 *
 * The compatibility registry is only useful if the hint reaches the browser, and
 * the unit tests cannot show that: they mock the registry and render the component
 * in isolation, so they would still pass if the hint were never mounted in the
 * connection dialog. This spec asserts the real registry, rendered inside the real
 * dialog, in a real browser.
 *
 * It also guards the negative case. Several of PostgreSQL's verified relatives have
 * reduced support, and one of them (CockroachDB) must never be presented as though
 * it worked fully - that is the exact overclaim the issue forbids. The count is left
 * out on purpose: it moved from three to four the moment Apache Cloudberry landed as
 * partial, and a number in a comment nobody greps ages silently.
