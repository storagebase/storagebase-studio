/**
 * Editing an object's definition and applying it, in a real browser (#789 Phase 3, discussion #778).
 *
 * Every other layer of this feature is measured somewhere else: the providers against live engines,
 * the two routes against a mock provider, the pane and the dialog under happy-dom. Four things are
 * left that only a browser can answer, and this file exists for them.
 *
 * 1. The diff editor MOUNTS AND COMPUTES under the production Content-Security-Policy. Monaco's diff
 *    is worker-backed and this app's worker bundles are constructed from `blob:` URLs, so a policy
 *    that is one directive short shows an empty diff with nothing in the product pointing at the
 *    cause.
 * 2. That the console channel the CSP assertion reads actually carries a violation. An empty array
 *    is the same empty array on a clean page and on a page whose listener was never wired.
 * 3. The whole round trip, driven with REAL USER INPUT: Edit, type, preview, apply, and the pane
 *    re-reads the engine's own rendering of what was written.
 * 4. The apply marker's COORDINATE. An uncorrected coordinate is neither rejected NOR clamped by
 *    Monaco: it is kept as given, off the end of the document, and no unit test can see it.
 *    MEASURED on 2026-09-14 by wave 11's review: shifting the offset-to-position mapping in
 *    src/lib/db/object-edit.ts by 20 and rebuilding put `monaco.editor.getModelMarkers()` at
 *    line 27 of a NINE-LINE model, not at the model's last line. The marker below is asserted at
 *    line 7 column 3, the position in the READER's document, while the engine's own position is
 *    inside the roughly 20-line assembled batch and cannot produce that pair.
 *
 * There is no E2E baseline for the object tree at all, measured by grep before this file was
 * written, so it is also the first regression test for the Phase 2 tree and Source pane.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE IS PART OF THE DELIVERABLE. This spec owns a throwaway PostgreSQL container, creates
 * `app.order_total(integer)` in it and re-creates that function before every test, so an apply that
 * lands leaves the next test a known definition. Without a Docker daemon the spec SKIPS, annotated,
 * on the precedent of e2e/functional-smoke.spec.ts. MEASURED against postgres:16-alpine on
 * 2026-09-14; the day-one provider measurements behind the feature were taken on PostgreSQL 18.4 and
 * are recorded in docs/providers/postgres.md, not here.
 *
 * THE DESCRIBE TITLE BELOW IS LOAD-BEARING FOR CI SELECTION, so do not rename it for readability.
 * This spec needs a Docker daemon, and .github/workflows/ci.yml has exactly one job that has one:
 * it selects with `--grep "Functional smoke"`, while the container job that has no daemon excludes
 * with `--grep-invert "Functional smoke"`. Playwright greps the full title path, so the words
 * "Functional smoke" in the describe are what put these tests in the job that can run them and keep
 * them out of the job where `test.skip(!dockerAvailable())` would retire them in silence. MEASURED
 * on 2026-09-14 before the rename: `--grep "Functional smoke"` listed 1 test in 1 file and none of
 * these five, and `--grep-invert "Functional smoke"` listed all five. Both jobs stayed green while
 * this file ran on nobody's machine.
 *
 * The connection is created THROUGH THE REAL MODAL rather than seeded through SEED_CONFIG_PATH:
 * seeding would need an environment variable on the webServer entry in playwright.config.ts, which
 * this spec does not own, and driving the modal exercises one more surface a user has to pass.

 * Reload once, and then press the PANE'S OWN Try again until the restored tab's read lands (X22).
 *
 * MEASURED on 2026-09-14, locally, with `--retries=0` and the CI selection
 * (`--project=chromium --grep "Functional smoke"`, one worker): the assertion below failed on its
 * FIRST attempt exactly as it does in CI, and the page snapshot Playwright captured says why. The
 * source pane read `The source read failed. / Too many requests. Try again in 41 seconds.` and the
 * object tree beside it read `The object list could not be read / Too many requests. Try again in
 * 41 seconds.` So it is the FIRST of the two candidates the filing named, the shared account's
 * query budget, and not a late affordance: the affordance was not slow, the read was refused, and
 * 41 seconds is longer than the 30-second assertion that was waiting for it.
 *
 * The arithmetic behind that, from `src/lib/api/rate-limit.ts`: every test in this file and in
 * `functional-smoke.spec.ts` signs in as the same `user@storagebase.org`, whose per-process `query`
 * bucket is 120 requests per 60 seconds and is shared by every database-reaching route including
 * all nine under `db/objects`. A `page.reload()` re-hydrates the whole application on top of
 * whatever three earlier tests already spent. The bucket is a FIXED window and a refused request
 * does not increment the counter, so waiting out the `Retry-After` the server itself names buys a
 * full fresh budget rather than one slot.
 *
 * THE PANE'S OWN CONTROL, and not a second reload, which is the difference X22's fix made. The
 * source pane used to draw the engine's sentence and no control at all, so a tab that had recorded
 * a failure never re-read - `needsRead` in `ObjectSourceView` is
 * `document === undefined && failure === undefined` - and reloading the page was the only way back
 * for this test and for a reader. It is also the expensive way back: a reload re-hydrates the whole
 * application against the very budget that was exhausted, so each attempt spends more of what it is
 * waiting for. `object-source-failure-retry` costs one request, and pressing the control the
 * product offers is what the reader in front of that message now does, exactly as
 * `waitForTheObjectTree` presses `tree-retry`.
 *
 * The single reload is still the restore under test. `PersistedTabState` persists a Source tab's
 * address and never its document or its failure, so the reload restores the tab from localStorage
 * and issues a fresh read, and the draft the previous step saved is still in the draft store.
