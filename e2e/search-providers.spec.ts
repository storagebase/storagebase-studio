/**
 * Gate 5 for issue #424 Phase 1.
 *
 * The unit and integration tests drive the two providers through a fake transport, so
 * they prove the code is right and prove nothing about whether a user can reach it.
 * Everything a new type-id needs in order to be SELECTABLE lives outside the provider
 * - the `DatabaseType` union, `DB_UI_CONFIG`, `selectableTypes`, an icon export - and
 * a miss in any of them leaves a provider that works and cannot be picked. Two of
 * those surfaces are not type-enforced (measured during Phase 1 recon), which is
 * exactly why this runs in a browser.
