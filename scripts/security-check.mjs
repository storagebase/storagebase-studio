/**
 * Posture-page drift guard for docs/SECURITY.md.
 *
 * The programme design specified "assert that each linked file exists". That is not enough, and
 * Phase 2 is the evidence: its digest-pinning guard - protecting the one scanner allowed to block a
 * merge - inspected a single physical line and stayed green against the exact downgrade it existed
 * to catch. #502 fixed the same shape on the route-guard allowlist. A check that
 * cannot fail is worse than no check, because it is believed.
 *
 * Seven checks, each of which a deliberate sabotage turns red:
 *
 *   1. RESOLVE  every markdown link in "Enforced in" and "Verified by" points at a real file
 *   2. RUN      every linked path under tests/ or e2e/ is actually executed by a runner
 *   3. PROVE    every "Verified by" link is itself a test - a source file or a policy document
 *               does not count, no matter how real it is (0.4 and 0.5 shipped this exact gap)
 *   4. ACCOUNT  every tests/security/*.test.ts(x) file is named by at least one row
 *   5. CLAIM    Status is from a closed set, and a claim of Implemented/Partial links a verifier
 *   6. COVER    the row IDs are exactly the programme's controls (a zero-row parse fails here)
 *   7. UNIQUE   no row ID repeats (all-16-plus-a-second-0.1 is neither missing nor extra)
 *
 * NOT checked, deliberately and stated on the page itself: whether a linked test actually
 * exercises the control it is linked from. No script can decide that honestly.
 *
 * Pure functions below are unit tested in tests/unit/security-check.test.ts.
