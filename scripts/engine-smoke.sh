# Engine-matrix smoke: boot the standalone payload through the npx launcher
# (bin/studio.js --archive) on the CURRENT `node` and assert the runtime tier
# behaves as documented. This is what makes the package.json engines floor
# (>=24.0.0, issue #326) a tested claim instead of a hope:
#
#   tier node24 (Node 24 LTS, the reference runtime the payload is built on)
#   tier node26 (the current upper release)
#
# Both tiers assert the SAME outcome - no launcher warning, everything works,
# including STORAGE_PROVIDER=sqlite. That is the point of the node26 leg: the
# payload is built on Node 24, so a green node26 run proves the payload's two
# native modules - better-sqlite3 (N-API since v13) and the DuckDB driver's
# @duckdb/node-bindings addon - are genuinely ABI-independent. Under
# better-sqlite3 v12's per-ABI binding this leg could not have passed.
#
# Both are exercised, not just asserted in prose: STORAGE_PROVIDER=sqlite drives
# the first and a DuckDB query drives the second.
#
# Runtimes below the floor are not a tier here: `npx` never reaches this script
# on them. npm's version picker silently resolves the newest ENGINE-COMPATIBLE
# release instead, so a Node 22 user lands on the last <24 release rather than
# on a preflight error. npx-engine-smoke.yml asserts that pinning behaviour
# against the live registry; the launcher's own refusal path is unit-tested in
# tests/unit/launcher-utils.test.ts.
#
# Usage: scripts/engine-smoke.sh <payload-tarball> <node24|node26>
#   PORT (default 3105) and PORT+1 must be free.
#
# Used by the engine-smoke job in .github/workflows/ci.yml; runs locally too
# (e.g. inside `docker run node:26-trixie-slim` with the repo and tarball
# mounted).
