/**
 * Distribution visibility matrix checker.
 *
 * Reads the human-maintained channel inventory (distribution/channels.yaml),
 * measures every live channel's pinned version against package.json, and
 * prints a markdown drift table (also appended to GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY when
 * set). Warn-only by default so existing PaaS drift never breaks a release;
 * `--strict` exits 1 only for owned local_file pins whose update SLA is
 * every_release - remote catalogs are upstream-owned and never gate.
 *
 * `--matrix` is this file's second job: it regenerates the marker regions of
 * docs/CHANNELS.md (the audience coverage matrix) from the same channel
 * inventory. `--check` alongside it verifies those regions are up to date
 * without writing, for use as a freshness gate.
 *
 * The checker only ever READS channels.yaml; version bumps in pin files and
 * inventory edits are human work (see docs/DISTRIBUTION.md). Mirrors the
 * style of scripts/sync-chart-version.mjs; the pure functions below are unit
 * tested in tests/unit/distribution-check.test.ts.
