# Prune non-runtime repo-root extras from an assembled standalone payload
# (issue #124): Next.js output file tracing sweeps the repo root, dragging
# docs, source, tooling configs, the lockfile and deploy manifests into
# .next/standalone - and from there into every payload-derived artifact
# (release tarballs, .deb/.rpm, snap, npx cache). On a local (non-CI)
# checkout the sweep also picks up gitignored build leftovers (dist/,
# coverage/, *.snap); the deny-list covers the project-conventional ones,
# but arbitrary personal files at the repo root can still leak into LOCAL
# builds - CI release checkouts are clean, so releases are unaffected.
#
# Deny-list semantics, payload-ROOT entries only: nothing nested inside a
# kept directory (node_modules/, .next/, public/, ...) is touched, and no
# dot-directory is on the list - the runtime needs the hidden .next dir
# (see the snap 0.9.52 fileset incident for how easily it gets dropped).
# The runtime keep-list documented in scripts/build-standalone-payload.sh
# (server.js, package.json, .next, node_modules, public, data) must always
# survive this step; LICENSE and README.md are deliberately kept too
# (release-artifact convention; the MIT notice travels with the payload).
#
# Usage: prune-standalone-payload.sh <payload-dir>
