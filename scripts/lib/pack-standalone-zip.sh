# Pack an assembled standalone payload directory into a FLAT zip for the
# win32-x64 release artifact (issue #114).
#
# Flat means entries sit at the archive root (server.js, .next/, node/,
# storagebase-studio.exe, ...) with NO storagebase-studio-<version>/ wrapper - the
# opposite of the POSIX tarball layout (issue #133). Two consumers force
# this:
#   - winget extracts the zip in place and resolves
#     NestedInstallerFiles.RelativeFilePath against the zip root; a
#     versioned wrapper directory would change that path on every release
#     (wingetcreate update does not rewrite RelativeFilePath).
#   - Chocolatey's Install-ChocolateyZipPackage unzips into the package
#     tools dir, where the launcher exe must land at a stable depth for
#     shimming.
# Windows Explorer's "Extract All" already defaults to a directory named
# after the zip, so a flat archive is not a zipbomb hazard for manual users.
#
# Packs with 7-Zip (preinstalled on the windows-latest runner image), then
# asserts the resulting layout is really flat and complete - a zip missing
# server.js or .next/ must fail here, not at install time.
#
# Usage: pack-standalone-zip.sh <payload-dir> <output-zip>
