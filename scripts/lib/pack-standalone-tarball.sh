# Wrap an assembled standalone payload directory in a top-level
# storagebase-studio-<version>/ root before tarring it (issue #133): a
# conventional release-tarball layout instead of a tarbomb (entries at
# archive root). Consumers extract with `tar --strip-components=1` (see
# bin/lib/launcher-utils.mjs's extractTarball and
# .github/workflows/release-artifacts.yml); Homebrew strips a single
# top-level directory automatically for its main url/sha256 download.

# Resolve the output path before tar sees it, the way pack-standalone-zip.sh
# resolves its own. GNU tar reads a -f argument whose first colon comes before
# any slash as `host:file` and tries to reach that host: measured with tar 1.35,
# `-f out:1.tar.gz` answers "Cannot connect to out: resolve failed" and exits 2
# having written nothing. Every absolute path a Windows caller has is that shape
# (`C:\...`), so a bash script driven from node, Bun or PowerShell there dials a
# host called C instead of writing a file. An absolute path cannot be misread.
# scripts/build-standalone-payload.sh, the one production caller, already passes
# an absolute POSIX path, so this leaves the release build untouched.
