# Build the StorageBase Studio desktop Linux artifacts (issues #232, #241).
#
# The desktop shell (desktop/src-tauri, Tauri v2) is a thin native window that
# runs the SAME standalone server payload every other channel ships as a sidecar
# process. This script assembles the three pieces the bundler needs and renames
# the results to the repo's release-asset convention:
#
#   desktop/src-tauri/payload/            <- standalone payload (server.js + .next)
#   desktop/src-tauri/bin/storagebase-studio-node-<triple>
#                                         <- pinned, checksum-verified Node runtime
#   desktop/src-tauri/target/.../*.AppImage
#     -> <out>/storagebase-studio-desktop-<version>-linux-<arch>.AppImage (+ .sha256)
#   desktop/src-tauri/target/.../*.deb
#     -> <out>/storagebase-studio-desktop_<version>_<debarch>.deb (+ .sha256)
#
# Both come out of one bundler run. The GUI .deb exists because FlatPark
# (issue #241) repackages a vendor download as Flatpak extra-data and rejects
# AppImages outright - its runtime has no libfuse, so an AppImage cannot be
# unpacked at install time. It is also the natural package for Debian/Ubuntu
# desktop users; the similarly named storagebase-studio_<version>_<arch>.deb is the
# headless systemd server and is built by packaging/linux/nfpm.yaml instead.
#
# The script name still says "appimage": it is referenced by name from
# .github/workflows/flatpak-smoke.yml path filters and release-artifacts.yml,
# and renaming it silently disarms those gates. Read it as "the desktop Linux
# bundler".
#
# Usage: scripts/build-desktop-appimage.sh <output-dir> [options]
#
#   --payload <tarball>  reuse an existing standalone tarball
#                        (storagebase-studio-standalone-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz)
#                        instead of building one. This is what release CI does:
#                        the tarball is already built by the `build` job.
#   --smoke              after bundling, extract the AppImage and boot the
#                        payload's server from inside the extracted AppDir with
#                        the bundled node, requiring GET /api/db/health to return
#                        200. Proves the bundle is complete WITHOUT needing a
#                        display (the GUI itself is verified by hand / by the
#                        Flatpak E2E in docs/DISTRIBUTION.md).
#   --keep-stage         do not delete payload/ and bin/ afterwards (local dev:
#                        makes `bunx tauri dev` runnable straight after).
#   --deb-only           bundle only the .deb, skipping the AppImage. The
#                        AppImage bundler drives linuxdeploy and its gtk plugin,
#                        which needs the GTK/librsvg -dev packages installed on
#                        the build host; the .deb needs none of them. Lets
#                        someone working on the FlatPark package (issue #241)
#                        build what they need without that toolchain. Release CI
#                        never passes this - both artifacts are required assets.
#
# Requirements: bun, node, cargo (Rust >= 1.88), and the Tauri Linux system deps
# (libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev, libgtk-3-dev, libayatana-appindicator3-dev, librsvg2-dev,
# patchelf, file). See desktop/README.md.
