/**
 * Decides whether a release should be submitted to one community operator
 * catalog, and which bundle it replaces there (issue #656).
 *
 * Everything that decides is a pure function below. The CLI at the bottom is a
 * thin shell: it reads the version directories of a checked-out catalog and
 * the target repository's open pull requests, then prints GITHUB_OUTPUT lines.
 * That split is deliberate - the same logic used to live as a `sort -V |
 * grep -B1` pipeline inside a workflow step, where it could not be tested.
 *
 * Why the predecessor cannot come from this repository: `spec.replaces` must
 * name the version immediately preceding ours *in the catalog being submitted
 * to*, which lags our releases by however many submissions are unmerged and
 * differs between the two catalogs. Both upstream gates reject a graph that is
 * not linked that way, and neither accepts `olm.skipRange` as a substitute:
 *
 *   k8s-operatorhub  `opm index add --mode replaces` ->
 *                    "add prunes bundle ... skips/replaces []"
 *   community-operators-prod (FBC)  `opm validate` ->
 *                    "multiple channel heads found in graph"
 *
 * Both were measured, the second on community-operators-prod#11106.
 *
 * Pure functions are unit tested in tests/unit/operator-catalog-submission.test.ts.
