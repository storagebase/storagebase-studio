/**
 * Localized README drift guard.
 *
 * README_zh.md and README_ja.md (#317) restate two things README.md already
 * says: which engines exist, and what the install commands are. Both are
 * hardcoded in all three files, and the repo has no other check that notices
 * when they diverge - `distribution:check` covers channels.yaml, `chart:check`
 * covers the chart, nothing covered this. Review of #317 found a Homebrew row
 * missing its mandatory `brew trust`, a Snap row missing `sudo`, and a Helm row
 * that added a repo without installing anything; the next provider to land will
 * leave both translations claiming the old engine count.
 *
 * Three invariants, chosen so that abridgement stays legal and errors do not:
 *
 *   1. The engine name set is identical in all three files. A translation that
 *      omits an engine is wrong, and so is one that invents an engine.
 *   2. Every command in a localized install table appears verbatim in
 *      README.md's. Localized files may list fewer channels - they deliberately
 *      drop Chocolatey and the portable zip - but may not paraphrase a command.
 *   3. Every README carries the plain-HTTP login warning as a blockquote. This
 *      one drifted the other way: all five translations warned that a browser
 *      reaching Studio over plain http on a non-loopback host needs
 *      AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=false, and README.md carried the variable only as a
 *      row of its environment table, hundreds of lines below the quickstart.
 *      A reader who follows the quickstart hits a silent login loop while the
 *      health check passes - the same failure four deployment channels have
 *      now shipped (#232, Unraid, #307, #901).
 *
 * Tables are located structurally (the table holding the PostgreSQL row, the
 * table holding `docker run`) rather than by heading text, because the headings
 * are in Chinese and Japanese.
 *
 * Pure functions below are unit tested in tests/unit/readme-check.test.ts.
