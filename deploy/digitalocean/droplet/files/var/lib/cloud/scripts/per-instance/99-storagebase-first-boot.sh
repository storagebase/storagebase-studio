# The droplet is reached at http://<ip>:3000 and has no name of its own, so the
# deployment is plain HTTP. Without AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=false the app marks its
# auth cookie Secure for a non-loopback host, the browser discards it, and login
# loops back silently while every health probe still passes. The AWS image writes
# the same line for the same reason (deploy/aws/ami/files/usr/local/sbin/storagebase-firstboot).
# If TLS is put in front of the Droplet later, set AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true here and
# restart storagebase-studio: the override wins over x-forwarded-proto, so the flag does
# not come back on its own.
