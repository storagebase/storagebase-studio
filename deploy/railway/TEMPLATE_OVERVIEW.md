# Deploy and Host storagebase-studio on Railway

StorageBase Studio is an open-source, web-based SQL IDE for cloud-native teams. Query PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, libSQL, DuckDB, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB, Redis, Couchbase, ClickHouse, Apache Druid, Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Apache Trino and Apache Cassandra from your browser — with an ERD viewer, schema diff, a data profiler, and optional AI on your own model key: a read-only agent that investigates a question and cites the result each claim came from, plus one-click explanation of a query on the engines that return an `EXPLAIN` plan. No desktop client required.

## About Hosting storagebase-studio

Hosting StorageBase Studio means running a single stateless Next.js container that serves the web IDE and proxies queries to the databases you connect to. This template runs the prebuilt `ghcr.io/storagebase/storagebase-studio` image on port 3000 with a healthcheck at `/api/db/health` — no build step required. Saved connections and settings are persisted with SQLite on an attached Railway volume (`/app/data`), so they survive restarts and redeploys. Authentication is JWT-based; a strong `JWT_SECRET` and admin/user passwords are auto-generated per deploy. Optional add-ons — AI providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama, custom), OIDC SSO, or a PostgreSQL storage backend — are enabled later via environment variables.

## Common Use Cases

- Give a team a browser-based SQL console for cloud databases, with no desktop client to install or update.
- Spin up an admin/query UI right next to a Railway PostgreSQL or MySQL database in the same project.
- Ask the read-only agent a question and get an answer whose every claim cites the result it came from — it executes SQL on PostgreSQL, SQLite and DuckDB only, in a session the database itself enforces as read-only, and on every other connection it drafts a statement for you to run yourself.
- Draft a statement before anything runs: plan mode executes nothing it drafts, on every engine — its one reach into the database is the schema capture that grounds it, metadata only and no data rows — and the only statement that lands in your editor and runs there is the hand-over you consent to when the run opens.
- Explain an unfamiliar query in plain English, with the connected schema as context and the engine's own `EXPLAIN` plan as the source — offered on PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, libSQL, DuckDB, Couchbase, ClickHouse, Apache Druid and Apache Trino, the engines that return a plan.

## Dependencies for storagebase-studio Hosting

- A database to connect to — any of the sixteen engines above (bring your own, or add a Railway database to the project).
- A persistent volume mounted at `/app/data` for the SQLite-backed store of saved connections and settings (included in this template).

### Deployment Dependencies

- Source & docs: https://github.com/storagebase/storagebase-studio
- Container image (GHCR): https://github.com/storagebase/storagebase-studio/pkgs/container/storagebase-studio
- README / configuration: https://github.com/storagebase/storagebase-studio#readme

### Implementation Details

After the service is healthy, open its public domain and log in with the **admin** account (`admin@storagebase.org`) — the generated `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is shown in the service's **Variables** tab. A standard query-only user (`user@storagebase.org`) is also created.

To query a database hosted on Railway, add one to the project (**+ New → Database → PostgreSQL/MySQL**) and create a connection in Studio using the database's provided variables (`PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`).

Optional environment variables enable extra features:

```bash
# AI query assistance
LLM_PROVIDER=gemini          # gemini | openai | ollama | custom
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash

# SSO (OIDC) — Auth0, Keycloak, Okta, Azure AD
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc
OIDC_ISSUER=https://your-tenant.example.com
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=...
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

## Why Deploy storagebase-studio on Railway?

<!-- Recommended: Keep this section as shown below -->
Railway is a singular platform to deploy your infrastructure stack. Railway will host your infrastructure so you don't have to deal with configuration, while allowing you to vertically and horizontally scale it.

By deploying storagebase-studio on Railway, you are one step closer to supporting a complete full-stack application with minimal burden. Host your servers, databases, AI agents, and more on Railway.
