# StorageBase Studio — CapRover One-Click App

This folder is the **source of truth** for deploying StorageBase Studio on
[CapRover](https://caprover.com) as a one-click app.

> Tracking issue: [storagebase-studio#56](https://github.com/storagebase/storagebase-studio/issues/56)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `storagebase-studio.yml` | CapRover `captainVersion: 4` template (Docker-Compose + `caproverOneClickApp` block). |
| `storagebase-studio.png` | 256×256 app logo used by the CapRover one-click UI. |

Both files are submitted as a PR to
[`caprover/one-click-apps`](https://github.com/caprover/one-click-apps)
(`public/v4/apps/storagebase-studio.yml` + `public/v4/logos/storagebase-studio.png`) —
the official listing, merged and live.

## Install (official one-click apps catalog)

CapRover dashboard → **Apps → One-Click Apps/Databases** → search **StorageBase Studio**.
No third-party repo to add.

The StorageBase 3rd-party repo that served this app while the official submission was
in review is now retired. Source for that repo:
<https://github.com/storagebase/caprover-one-click-apps>.

## Install (manual template — works today, no repo needed)

CapRover dashboard → **Apps → One-Click Apps/Databases** → select
**`>> TEMPLATE <<`** at the bottom of the dropdown → paste the contents of
`storagebase-studio.yml` → **Next**.

## What the template does

- Runs `ghcr.io/storagebase/storagebase-studio` (pinned version, never `:latest`) on
  container HTTP port `3000`.
- Generates a strong `JWT_SECRET` and admin/user passwords automatically and
  echoes the login credentials on the final install screen.
- Persists saved connections & settings with **SQLite** on a CapRover
  persistent volume (`$$cap_appname-data` → `/app/data`), surviving restarts
  and redeploys.
- Exposes optional AI/LLM fields (Gemini, OpenAI, Ollama, custom) — leave blank
  to disable.

## Post-install options

Set these under the app's **App Configs** tab to extend the deployment:

- **SSO / OIDC** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_PROVIDER=oidc`, `OIDC_ISSUER`,
  `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OIDC_ROLE_CLAIM`, `OIDC_ADMIN_ROLES`.
- **PostgreSQL storage backend** (multi-node) — `STORAGE_PROVIDER=postgres`,
  `STORAGE_POSTGRES_URL=...`.

## Maintaining this template

When a new Studio version is released, bump the version in `storagebase-studio.yml`
and submit an update PR to the official repo. The version appears **twice** in
that file — the `defaultValue` of `$$cap_version` and the example inside its
`description` — and both must move together. Validate locally with the CapRover
repo's tooling:

```bash
npm ci && npm run validate_apps && npm run formatter
```

Two things to know before you bump:

- **Nothing verifies this file.** `bun run distribution:check` pins
  `caprover-official` with `remote_file` against the catalog, which is
  deliberate: that pin must measure what upstream actually serves. No gate
  measures the copy in this folder, so it can silently fall behind a release.
  Tracked in [#268](https://github.com/storagebase/storagebase-studio/issues/268).
- **Check upstream first.** This folder leads and the catalog follows, but that
  order has been broken once: [caprover/one-click-apps#1315](https://github.com/caprover/one-click-apps/pull/1315)
  bumped the catalog to 0.9.59 directly, leaving this file on 0.9.14 until it
  was resynced. Compare against the live template before assuming this copy is
  ahead:

  ```bash
  curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caprover/one-click-apps/master/public/v4/apps/storagebase-studio.yml \
    | diff -u storagebase-studio.yml -
  ```
