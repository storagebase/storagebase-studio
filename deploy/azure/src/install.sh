  !! No publicly trusted certificate could be issued yet, so Caddy is serving its own
     self-signed certificate on the same port. The URL above is the right one and the

     arrives. Nothing needs to be restored by hand: self-signed certificates are
     short-lived by design, and Caddy retries Let's Encrypt on every renewal cycle,
     switching over on its own as soon as issuance succeeds.
     Likely causes: a Let's Encrypt rate limit or outage, or a firewall that keeps port
     80 unreachable. Which one it was:
       docker logs storagebase-caddy 2>&1 | grep -i -m5 'acme\|challenge\|rate limit'
     * A connection error or timeout while fetching the challenge means port 80 was not
       reachable from the internet. That is measurable: from ANY machine other than this
       one, run
         curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' --max-time 10 http://${SITE_ADDRESS}/
       Any HTTP status (404 included) means port 80 is reachable and the next renewal
       cycle should succeed. A timeout means something still blocks it - that is yours
       to fix, and nothing else will help until it is.
     * A rate limit needs no action at all: Let's Encrypt limits reset on a rolling
       weekly window and the retry happens by itself.
