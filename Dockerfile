# Build with Node.js to avoid Bun/QEMU segfaults on ARM64.
# trixie-slim keeps the toolchain consistent with the oven/bun deps stage, but
# it is no longer load-bearing for the better-sqlite3 native module: v13 ships
# every prebuild inside the package and picks one in the RUNNING process
# (lib/binding.js reads process.platform/arch and detects musl via
# process.report), so neither the ABI nor the libc of the installing stage
# constrains the stage that requires it.
#
# @duckdb/node-api works differently and the reasoning above does NOT transfer:
# its binaries live in separate per-libc, per-platform packages
# (@duckdb/node-bindings-<platform>-<arch>[-musl]), so the libc choice is made
# partly at INSTALL time - which optional package the deps stage fetches - and
# partly at runtime, where @duckdb/node-bindings uses detect-libc to pick
# between whichever ones are present. Every stage here is glibc, so the glibc
# package is the one installed and the one loaded; keeping the stages on the
# same base is what makes that hold.

# @duckdb/node-bindings-<platform>-<arch> holding duckdb.node next to the
# ~70 MB libduckdb.so it links against (NEEDED libduckdb.so, RUNPATH $ORIGIN,
# so the two must stay in the same directory). Copying the whole @duckdb scope
# in one line is also what keeps the ARM64 cross-build working: the deps stage
# installs only the optional package matching the build arch, so naming a
# platform package here would break that leg. detect-libc is what
# @duckdb/node-bindings requires to choose between a glibc and a musl package;
# it is required inside a try/catch that silently falls back to glibc, so its
# absence would never announce itself - ship it rather than rely on tracing.

# Copy the Oracle driver (#538). It is pure JavaScript in its default Thin mode,
# which is why it was never copied before, but Thick mode
# (ORACLE_CLIENT_LIB_DIR) makes node-oracledb load a native addon and that addon
# is missed by BOTH build stages, for two separate reasons.
# 1. Bundling: node-oracledb resolves the addon relative to its own __dirname,
#    and Turbopack rewrote that to the literal string /ROOT/node_modules/
#    oracledb/lib, so initOracleClient() died with NJS-045 before it ever looked
#    at the Instant Client. That is why the package is now in
#    serverExternalPackages (next.config.ts); this COPY is what makes "external"
#    resolvable at runtime.
# 2. Tracing: even externalized, Next's output file tracing copies index.js,
#    lib/ and package.json but not build/Release/*.node, because the addon is
#    reached through a computed require(path) rather than a literal specifier -
#    the same blind spot as @libredb/libredb and the @duckdb scope.
# The whole package directory, never one file: build/ holds a binary per
# platform and arch (~3 MB total), and naming one would break the ARM64 leg.
# This image stays Thin-only - no Instant Client, no libaio - so the addon sits
# unused until an operator layers a client on top; see docs/providers/oracle.md.
